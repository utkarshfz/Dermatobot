1,acne vulgaris,"Acne results in a variety of lesions. The most common acne locations include the face, neck, chest, and back, where the most sebaceous glands are located. Along the jaw line is a common location in adults. ""Blackheads"" (open comedones) and ""whiteheads"" (closed comedones) are follicular plugs that are either sitting below the skin surface (whitehead) or oxidized from being exposed to the air (blackhead). Papules are small pink to reddish-brown bumps, pustules are pus-filled lesions, and nodules or cysts are deeper pus-filled lesions. Mild acne consists of a few papules/pustules and/or comedones. Moderate acne has an increased number of lesions. Severe acne has numerous comedones, papules, pustules, and may have painful nodules. Acne can result in permanent scars, which can appear to be depressions in the skin or hyperpigmentation, which is dark red or brown flat marks where the acne lesions were.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is thought to be caused by multiple factors. Overproduction of a normal oil on the skin, called sebum, increases under the influence of hormones. This, coupled with insufficient shedding of exfoliating dead skin cells, plugs hair follicles. The plugged follicle can become inflamed and have increased growth of normal skin bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes. Medications such as lithium, cortisone, hormones, iodides, some seizure medications, or isoniazid can also cause acne lesions. There is no cure for acne, but certain measures can help prevent more breakouts. Acne can result in scarring, so minimizing breakouts is important.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne vulgaris is the formation of comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and/or cysts as a result of obstruction and inflammation of pilosebaceous units (hair follicles and their accompanying sebaceous gland). Acne develops on the face and upper trunk. It most often affects adolescents. Diagnosis is by examination. Treatment, based on severity, can involve a variety of topical and systemic agents directed at reducing sebum production, comedone formation, inflammation, and bacterial counts and at normalizing keratinization.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Skin lesions and scarring can be a source of significant emotional distress. Nodules and cysts can be painful. Lesion types frequently coexist at different stages. Comedones appear as whiteheads or blackheads. Whiteheads (closed comedones) are flesh-colored or whitish palpable lesions 1 to 3 mm in diameter; blackheads (open comedones) are similar in appearance but with a dark center. Papules and pustules are red lesions 2 to 5 mm in diameter. Papules are relatively deep. Pustules are more superficial. Nodules are larger, deeper, and more solid than papules. Such lesions resemble inflamed epidermoid cysts, although they lack true cystic structure. Cysts are suppurative nodules. Rarely, cysts form deep abscesses. Long-term cystic acne can cause scarring that manifests as tiny and deep pits (icepick scars), larger pits, shallow depressions, or hypertrophic scarring or keloids. ",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne most often affects the face, but it may spread to involve the neck, chest and back, and sometimes even more extensively over the body. Individual lesions are centred on the pilosebaceous unit, ie the hair follicle and its associated oil gland. Several types of acne spots occur, often at the same time. They may be inflamed papules, pustules and nodules; or non-inflamed comedones and pseudocysts.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne vulgaris is a common chronic skin disease involving blockage and/or inflammation of pilosebaceous units (hair follicles and their accompanying sebaceous gland). Acne can present as noninflammatory lesions, inflammatory lesions, or a mixture of both, affecting mostly the face but also the back and chest.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin condition that occurs when dead skin cells and oil from the skin clog hair follicles.[10] Typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring.[1][2][11] It primarily affects skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and back",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Typical features of acne include increased secretion of oily sebum by the skin, microcomedones, comedones, papules, nodules (large papules), pustules, and often results in scarring.[29][30] The appearance of acne varies with skin color. It may result in psychological and social problems.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne scars are caused by inflammation within the dermis and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris.[31] Abnormal healing and dermal inflammation create the scar.[32] Scarring is most likely to take place with severe acne but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris.[31] Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss at the site of the acne lesion. Atrophic acne scars have lost collagen from the healing response and are the most common type of acne scar (accounting for approximately 75% of all acne scars).[32][33] Ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars are subtypes of atrophic acne scars.[31] Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4 mm across.[32] Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2 mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis.[32] Rolling scars are broader than ice-pick and boxcar scars (4–5 mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin. Hypertrophic scars are uncommon and are characterized by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response.[32] They are described as firm and raised from the skin.[32][34] Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders.[32] Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on the trunk of the body.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"After an inflamed nodular acne lesion resolves, it is common for the skin to darken in that area, which is known as postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). The inflammation stimulates specialized pigment-producing skin cells (known as melanocytes) to produce more melanin pigment, which leads to the skin's darkened appearance.[35] PIH occurs more frequently in people with darker skin color.[36] Pigmented scar is a common term used for PIH, but is misleading as it suggests the color change is permanent. Often, PIH can be prevented by avoiding any aggravation of the nodule and can fade with time. However, untreated PIH can last for months, years, or even be permanent if deeper layers of skin are affected.[37] Even minimal skin exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays can sustain hyperpigmentation.[35] Daily use of SPF 15 or higher sunscreen can minimize such a risk.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disorder of pilosebaceous unit, which runs a chronic course and it is self-limiting. Acne vulgaris is triggered by propionibacterium acnes in adolescence, under the influence of normal circulating dehydroepiandrosterone. It is a very common skin disorder which can present with inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of acne vulgaris and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne vulgaris is a skin condition that occurs when hair follicles are blocked with dead skin cells, bacteria, and oil (sebum). The blocked follicles cause blemishes on the skin, including pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, and cysts. Also known as common acne, one of its main causes is hormones, especially around puberty.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Most acne occurs on the face, chest, back, and shoulders. Symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe. If you have mild acne, you probably have less than 20 blackheads or whiteheads. Whiteheads are small flesh-colored or whitish blemishes, while blackheads have a dark center. You might also develop pimples, which are round, inflamed whiteheads on the skin. If you have moderate acne, you’ll have a larger number of blackheads, whiteheads, and pimples.Severe acne may include widespread blemishes with nodules or cysts, which are larger and more solid than pimples. Nodules and cysts tend to be more painful than pimples. ",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne vulgaris is caused by a combination of hormones, oil, and bacteria. During puberty, a hormone called androgen increases and the sebaceous glands produce more of the oily substance sebum. Typically, sebum and dead skin cells come up through the hair follicles and out through the pores in the skin. When sebum, skins cells, and bacteria clog the follicles, the sebum can’t escape through the pores, which causes acne.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages. Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up. Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) Blackheads (open plugged pores) Small red, tender bumps (papules) Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"Four main factors cause acne: Excess oil (sebum) production Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells Bacteria Inflammation Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands. The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air. Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne.",,,,,,
1,acne vulgaris,"The typical symptoms of acne are blackheads (comedones), pimples, or nodes of the skin. The spots are often on the face, but other parts of the body can also be affected, such as shoulders, back, and chest. They usually occur in groups. The skin around and above these spots is sometimes reddened and painful. Over time, the affected skin may become darker or scarred. Only in extremely rare and severe cases do symptoms such as fever, joint pain, and general fatigue occur. Since acne often represents a psychological burden for those affected, additional symptoms can occur, such as depression, anxiety, and social isolation.",,,,,,

2,alopecia,"Alopecia areata is a condition that causes hair to fall out in small patches, which can be unnoticeable. These patches may connect, however, and then become noticeable. The condition develops when the immune system attacks the hair follicles, resulting in hair loss.Sudden hair loss may occur on the scalp, and in some cases the eyebrows, eyelashes, and face, as well as other parts of the body. It can also develop slowly and recur after years between instances. The condition can result in total hair loss, called alopecia universalis, and it can prevent hair from growing back. When hair does grow back, it’s possible for the hair to fall out again. The extent of hair loss and regrowth varies from person to person. There’s currently no cure for alopecia areata. However, there are treatments that may help hair grow back more quickly and that can prevent future hair loss, as well as unique ways to cover up the hair loss. Resources are also available to help people cope with stress related to hair loss.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"The main symptom of alopecia areata is hair loss. Hair usually falls out in small patches on the scalp. These patches are often several centimeters or less. Hair loss might also occur on other parts of the face, like the eyebrows, eyelashes, and beard, as well as other parts of the body. Some people lose hair in a few places. Others lose it in a lot of spots. You may first notice clumps of hair on your pillow or in the shower. If the spots are on the back of your head, someone may bring it to your attention. However, other health conditions can also cause hair to fall out in a similar pattern. Hair loss alone isn’t used to diagnose alopecia areata. The hair loss associated with alopecia areata is unpredictable and, as far as doctors and researchers can tell, appears to be spontaneous Trusted Source. The hair may grow back at any time and then may fall out again. The extent of hair loss and regrowth varies greatly from person to person.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Alopecia areata is believed to be an autoimmune disease resulting from a breach in the immune privilege of the hair follicles.[4] Risk factors include a family history of the condition.[2] Among identical twins, if one is affected, the other has about a 50% chance of also being affected.[2] The underlying mechanism involves failure by the body to recognize its own cells with subsequent immune mediated destruction of the hair follicle.[2]",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Typical first symptoms of alopecia areata are small bald patches. The underlying skin is unscarred and looks superficially normal. Although these patches can take many shapes, they are usually round or oval.[6] Alopecia areata most often affects the scalp and beard, but may occur on any part of the body with hair.[7] Different areas of the skin may exhibit hair loss and regrowth at the same time. The disease may also go into remission for a time, or may be permanent. It is common in children. The area of hair loss may tingle or be painful.[8] The hair tends to fall out over a short period of time, with the loss commonly occurring more on one side of the scalp than the other. Exclamation point hairs, narrower along the length of the strand closer to the base, producing a characteristic ""exclamation point"" appearance, are often present.[9] These hairs are very short (3–4 mm), and can be seen surrounding the bald patches. When healthy hair is pulled out, at most a few should come out, and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp. In cases of alopecia areata, hair tends to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the body's immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy. Nails may have pitting or trachyonychia.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Alopecia areata is thought to be a systemic autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks its own anagen hair follicles and suppresses or stops hair growth.[9] For example, T cell lymphocytes cluster around affected follicles, causing inflammation and subsequent hair loss. Hair follicles in a normal state are thought to be kept secure from the immune system, a phenomenon called immune privilege. A breach in this immune privilege state is considered as the cause of alopecia areata.[4] A few cases of babies being born with congenital alopecia areata have been reported. Alopecia areata is not contagious.[9] It occurs more frequently in people who have affected family members, suggesting heredity may be a factor.[9] Strong evidence of genetic association with increased risk for alopecia areata was found by studying families with two or more affected members. This study identified at least four regions in the genome that are likely to contain these genes.[12] In addition, alopecia areata shares genetic risk factors with other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and celiac disease.[3] It may be the only manifestation of celiac disease. Endogenous retinoids metabolic defect is a key part of the pathogenesis of the alopecia areata.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Hair loss, also known as alopecia or baldness, refers to a loss of hair from part of the head or body.[1] Typically at least the head is involved.[3] The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area to the entire body.[6] Inflammation or scarring is not usually present.[3] Hair loss in some people causes psychological distress. Common types include male- or female-pattern hair loss, alopecia areata, and a thinning of hair known as telogen effluvium.[3] The cause of male-pattern hair loss is a combination of genetics and male hormones; the cause of female pattern hair loss is unclear; the cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune; and the cause of telogen effluvium is typically a physically or psychologically stressful event.[3] Telogen effluvium is very common following pregnancy. Less common causes of hair loss without inflammation or scarring include the pulling out of hair, certain medications including chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition including iron deficiency.[2][3] Causes of hair loss that occurs with scarring or inflammation include fungal infection, lupus erythematosus, radiation therapy, and sarcoidosis.[2][3] Diagnosis of hair loss is partly based on the areas affected. Treatment of pattern hair loss may simply involve accepting the condition, which can also include shaving one's head.[3] Interventions that can be tried include the medications minoxidil (or finasteride) and hair transplant surgery.[4][5] Alopecia areata may be treated by steroid injections in the affected area, but these need to be frequently repeated to be effective.[3] Hair loss is a common problem.[3] Pattern hair loss by age 50 affects about half of men and a quarter of women.[3] About 2% of people develop alopecia areata at some point in time.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Symptoms of hair loss include hair loss in patches usually in circular patterns, dandruff, skin lesions, and scarring. Alopecia areata (mild – medium level) usually shows in unusual hair loss areas, e.g., eyebrows, backside of the head or above the ears, areas the male pattern baldness usually does not affect. In male-pattern hair loss, loss and thinning begin at the temples and the crown and hair either thins out or falls out. Female-pattern hair loss occurs at the frontal and parietal. People have between 100,000 and 150,000 hairs on their head. The number of strands normally lost in a day varies but on average is 100.[8] In order to maintain a normal volume, hair must be replaced at the same rate at which it is lost. The first signs of hair thinning that people will often notice are more hairs than usual left in the hairbrush after brushing or in the basin after shampooing. Styling can also reveal areas of thinning, such as a wider parting or a thinning crown.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Male pattern baldness (alopecia), or androgenetic alopecia, is the patterned balding of a man. Although the condition may affect both the appearance and self-esteem of some men, one should note that the condition is not a medical disorder. The hair loss is non-scarring and has a genetic basis. Sex steroids (androgens) – specifically, dihydrotestosterone – play a role in this form of balding.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"The most common location for male pattern baldness occurs at the frontal hairline. Hair loss may move toward the back of the scalp (posteriorly), or it may be first noted as thinning at the crown of the scalp. While the underlying scalp may appear normal, a man might see miniaturized hair follicles.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Female pattern baldness (alopecia) is a form of hair loss affecting women due to an inherited susceptibility. It is most commonly noticed after menopause, although it may begin earlier. Female pattern baldness is due to a combination of a family history of balding (in men or women from either parent's side of the family), aging, and hormones. Female pattern baldness is not due to a vitamin deficiency, poor circulation, dandruff, or wearing hats. There is progressive shrinking of the hair follicles until they produce only a fine, wispy hair or cease functioning.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,The pattern of hair loss is different in women than men; the hairline is preserved while there is diffuse thinning of the hair of the crown and frontal scalp. Total hair loss is very rare.,,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition resulting in hair loss. The immune system of the body mistakenly stops hair growth for unknown reasons. Hair loss may be patchy or sparse and may involve the rest of the body in addition to the scalp. Hair in most people spontaneously regrows, though recurrences of the condition are also typical. Genetic and environmental factors play a role in hair loss; the condition may be seasonal as well.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Hair loss most commonly occurs on the scalp, but it can also target the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, and other body sites. Symptoms may include the following: Round, patchy areas of non-scarring hair loss, ranging from mild to severe.  Mild: 1–5 scattered areas of hair loss on the scalp and beard. Moderate: More than 5 scattered areas of hair loss on the scalp and beard. Severe: loss of all of the hair on the scalp and body.  Scalp burning (without redness), accompanying lesions. Pitting and ridging of the fingernails. Hairs that do grow back often lack color, or may be either temporarily or permanently white. This hypopigmentation is not seen in other forms of alopecia.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes your hair to come out, often in clumps the size and shape of a quarter. The amount of hair loss is different in everyone. Some people lose it only in a few spots. Others lose a lot. Sometimes, hair grows back but falls out again later. In others, hair grows back for good. There are different types of this condition. Alopecia areata is most common in its main form, but there are other, more rare types: Alopecia areata totalis means you’ve lost all the hair on your head. Alopecia areata universalis is the loss of hair over your entire body. Diffuse alopecia areata is a sudden thinning of your hair rather than lost patches. Ophiasis alopecia areata causes hair loss in a band shape around the sides and back of your head.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"The main and often the only symptom of alopecia is hair loss. Small bald patches on your scalp or other parts of your body. Patches may get larger and grow together into a bald spot. Hair grows back in one spot and falls out in another. You lose a lot of hair over a short time. More hair loss in cold weather. Fingernails and toenails become red, brittle, and pitted. The bald patches of skin are smooth, with no rash or redness. But you may feel a tingling, itching, or burning sensation on your skin right before the hair falls out.",,,,,,

2,alopecia,"Alopecia areata is peculiar form of hair loss that usually affects the scalp but can occur on any hair-bearing skin. Alopecia areata produces one or more patches of balding without any obvious change in the texture of the affected skin, a non-scarring alopecia. Alopecia areata affects males and females. It is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, in which hair follicles, are damaged by a misguided immune system. For most patients, the condition resolves without treatment within a year, but hair loss is sometimes permanent.",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Current evidence suggests that alopecia areata is caused by an abnormality in the immune system that damages hair follicles. This particular abnormality leads to autoimmunity, a misguided immune system that tends to attack its own body. As a result, the immune system attacks particular tissues of the body. In alopecia areata, for unknown reasons, the body's own immune system attacks the hair follicles and disrupts normal hair formation. Biopsies of affected skin show immune lymphocytes penetrating into the hair bulb of the hair follicles.",,,,,,

Alopecia areata is also called autoimmune alopecia, which can also cause diffuse alopecia. ",,,,,,
2,alopecia,"Several clinical patterns of alopecia areata are described. More severe disease is associated with young age, concurrent atopic eczema, and chromosomal abnormalities. Most patients have no symptoms, and a bald patch or thinning hair is noted incidentally, often discovered by a hairdresser. Other patients describe a burning, prickly discomfort in the affected areas—this is known as trichodynia. Patches of alopecia areata can affect any hair-bearing area, most often the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes and beard. Sudden loss of hair Enlargement of bald patch or patches Regrowth of hair The bald areas may have a smooth surface, completely devoid of hair or with scattered 'exclamation mark' hairs. Exclamation mark hairs are 2 to 3 mm in length, broken or tapered, with a club-shaped root. Microscopy (also called dermoscopy or trichoscopy) shows a thin proximal shaft and normal calibre distal shaft. Regrowing hairs are often initially white or grey; they may be curly even when previously straight. It may take months and sometimes years to regrow all the hair.

3,actinic cheilitis,Actinic cheilitis (AC) is a lip inflammation caused by long-term sunlight exposure. It usually appears as very chapped lips,then may turn white or scaly. AC may be painless,but it can lead to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. You should see a doctor if you notice this type of patch on your lip.AC most often appears in people over 40 and is more common in men than women. People who spend a lot of time in the sun are most likely to develop AC. So if you’re often outside,you should take precautions to protect yourself,such as wearing lip balm with SPF.The first symptom of AC is usually dry,cracking lips. You might then develop either a red and swollen or white patch on your lip. This will almost always be on the lower lip. In more advanced AC,the patches might look scaly and feel like sandpaper. You might also notice that the line between your lower lip and skin becomes less clear. These discolored or scaly patches of skin are almost always painles
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis presents as diffuse or patchy dryness and variable thickening of the vermilion of the lower lip. The common form of actinic cheilitis is due to chronic sun exposure and is the lip form of actinic keratosis. It is also called actinic cheilosis, solar cheilitis, and sometimes, actinic cheilitis with histological atypia.Actinic cheilitis also describes lip involvement in actinic prurigo, a rare form of photosensitivity.Actinic cheilitis mainly affects adults with fair skin who live in tropical or subtropical areas, especially outdoor workers. They often recall having sunburned lips in earlier years. They may also have actinic keratoses on other sun-exposed sites of the scalp, ears, face and hands.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis causes dryness and thickening typically along the line that separates the lips from the skin of the face, otherwise known as the lower vermillion border.Actinic cheilitis is a precancerous condition caused by damage to the lip epithelium, which is the outer most tissue layer. The condition itself is not considered a serious health concern, but it increases the risk of skin cancer.Most people with actinic cheilitis develop similar symptoms. About 90 percent of cases involve the lower lip.",,,,,,

3,actinic cheilitis,"In actinic cheilitis, the current view is that the keratinocytes have undergone transformation forming a field of epithelium with the potential for neoplastic transformation. Clinical features include diffuse and poorly demarcated atrophic, erosive or keratotic plaques that may affect some parts of, or the entire vermilion border. Fair-complexioned people, those with albinism and people with eversion of the lip are all subject to actinic cheilitis. Prophylactic measures against all forms of sunlight-induced lesions must include limitation of exposure to the sun during peak sunlight hours, the use of appropriate protective clothing, and the use of a sunscreen cream. In this article, a case of albinism is used to illustrate the nature of actinic cheilitis, its clinical features and its treatment.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis is a pathological condition that most frequently affects the vermilion border of the lower lip.1–3 In persons with everted lower lips, as a racial characteristic or as an inherited trait, the mucosal surface of the lower lip, which is partly exposed to sunlight, is also affected. When both the upper and lower lips are prominent, as in bimaxillary protrusion, the upper lip may also be more vulnerable to sunlight exposure. In the past, actinic cheilitis was regarded as being potentially malignant, with not infrequent transformation into invasive, metastasizing squamous cell carcinoma.An alternative view states that the keratinocytes in actinic cheilitis have already undergone ultraviolet light-induced molecular and genetic transformation into neoplastic keratinocytes, that actinic cheilitis is in fact the result of clonal expansion of the transformed keratinocytes,3–7 and that it should be considered from its initiation to be an in-situ squamous cell carcinoma.8",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis is cheilitis (lip inflammation) caused by long term sunlight exposure. Essentially it is a burn,[2] and a variant of actinic keratosis which occurs on the lip.[5] It is a premalignant condition,[6] as it can develop into squamous cell carcinoma (a type of mouth cancer).AC almost always affects the lower lip and only rarely the upper lip, probably because the lower lip is more exposed to the sun.[7] In the unusual cases reported where it affects the upper lip, this may be due to upper lip prominence.[7] The commissures (corners of the mouth) are not usually involved.Affected individuals may experience symptoms such as a dry sensation and cracking of the lips.It is usually painless and persistent.There is thickening whitish discoloration of the lip at the border of the lip and skin. There is also a loss of the usually sharp border between the red of the lip and the normal skin, known as the vermillion border. The lip may become scaly and indurated as AC progresses.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"AC is the acronym for actinic cheilitis and is a condition where the lower lip becomes dry, rough, and thick with scales. It is mainly caused by the excessive exposure of the lips to the sun, and for this reason, actinic cheilitis is also known as solar cheilitis.It mostly affects men above 20 years of age, the elderly, and people who reside in hot tropical regions and dry places like deserts. Individuals most at risk include those with low immunity, a fair complexion, and those who have undergone organ transplants.Once detected, it is important to seek treatment for this disease as early as possible. Initially, treatment may cause some pain, swelling, and other effects, but these can be cured after completion of targeted therapies. There are many methods for treatment for AC, including carbon dioxide laser vaporization, electrosurgery, and cryosurgery.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis, sometimes known as ""farmer's lip"" or ""sailor's lip,"" is a precancerous condition related to cumulative lifetime sun exposure. The lower lip is most often affected. Individuals with actinic cheilitis often complain of persistent dryness and cracking of the lips. They will frequently exhibit other effects of sun-damaged skin, such as precancerous lesions on the skin called actinic keratoses and extensive wrinkling.A certain type of skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) develops in 6–10% of cases of actinic cheilitis.Actinic cheilitis is significantly more common in men, the elderly, and fair-skinned individuals. There is also a strong association with tobacco use.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"the cause? Solar cheilitis (also known as actinic cheilitis or cheilosis) is a degenerative condition of the tissue of the lips after years of exposure to ultraviolet (UV, mainly UVB) light, such as sunlight. It is a premalignant condition.Who is most at risk? Solar cheilitis is more common in adults and the risk increases with age. Men are affected more commonly than women. Individuals with fair skin (less protected from the sunlight) have a higher rate of solar changes. Outdoor workers who do not use sun protection are particularly at risk.Solar cheilitis predominantly affects the lower lip because it tends to be more prominent. The homogenous pink color of the healthy lip (Figure A) is replaced with non-homogenous white/gray, pink, red, or brown areas and the normally sharp vermillion/skin border becomes less distinct (Figure B). In more advanced stages, the lip may appear cracked or show ulcerations (ie sores) or crusting. Firmness or a non-healing ulcer within these changes may indicate an early cancer",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis (AC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the lips that is caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight in susceptible individuals. It affects the vermilion region of the lower lip almost exclusively. UV-B rays with a wavelength of 290-320 nm are held responsible for the sunlight-induced damage. The exact mechanism of the development of AC is unclear. It is considered to be potentially malignant.Actinic cheilitis (AC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the lips that is caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight in susceptible individuals. The word has been derived from the Greek words ""aktis"" meaning ""ray"" and ""cheilos"" meaning ""lips.""  It manifests almost exclusively on the vermilion regions of the lower lip. The vermilion border is the transition zone between the dry skin and the wet mucosa of the lips and has no secretory elements beneath it. Vermilion border of the lower lip is exposed to the environment and is more prone to develop various disorders than the upper lip.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"AC affects the lower lip exclusively because of its anatomic orientation that exposes it to sunlight. Although AC is considered to occur commonly in fair-skinned people, it is also found in dark-skinned people of India. Though AC can affect both men and women, men are affected much more commonly than women. This may be due to the fact that the professions involving outdoor work and exposure to sunlight are predominantly male oriented. However, women sharing professions like farm and field work, and construction work with men can be affected equally. AC may occur in a wide range of age, from 20 to 80 years. AC initially occurs as an asymptomatic dry lip affecting the lower lip vermilion.The best way of prevention of AC is to avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. Alternatively, the use of sun screens can help in preventing sunlight-induced damage. Chemical sunscreens absorb potentially harmful ultraviolet light, whereas physical sunscreens reflect it.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis has proved to be a condition for which CO2 laser therapy is considered the treatment of choice. It can be successfully treated by performing a laser vermilionectomy using any of the resurfacing lasers.This procedure usually requires only one pass with the laser over the vermilion surface and then spot treatment of persistently visible actinic damage. This has significantly reduced postoperative healing to approximately 10 days, in contrast to the 4 weeks required when the conventional CO2 laser was used in the past.Similar to actinic keratosis of the skin, actinic cheilitis (better actinic or solar cheilosis, because the initial changes are noninflammatory) represents a premalignant lesion of the vermilion, especially of the lower lip, caused by alterations induced by the ultraviolet components (ultraviolet B) of the sunlight. Actinic cheilitis is found especially in light-complexioned persons with a tendency to sunburn. Most patients are older than 50 years. Outdoor workkers are at risk.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Changes associated with actinic cheilitis develop slowly over time. It is a result of chronic sun exposure. People often complain of severely dry, flaking lips. It is associated with a rough texture, loss of lip volume with rhytid formation, white or red color change, and possible burning sensation. Patients report involvement of localized or diffuse areas involving the lower and/or upper lip.On physical examination, the following signs can be appreciated: scaly erythematous patches (localized or diffuse), atrophy, swelling or edema, white or gray color change, areas of pallor, ulcerations or erosions, rough texture, blunting of the separation between the mucosal and cutaneous lip, loss of the white roll, and increased vertical fissuring and rhytides.These changes are more commonly seen on the lower lip vermillion border.Acute erythema and scaling can be secondary to an allergic contact or irritant contact dermatitis. These entities are more acute, are associated with pruritus and/or burning,and are responsiv",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis is a precancerous lesion that forms most commonly on the lower lip. Similar to actinic keratosis, actinic cheilitis can undergo malignant transformation leading to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). SCC on the lips is 11 times as likely to metastasize compared to SCC found on other parts of the body. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of actinic cheilitis, a premalignant lesion found on the lips and highlights the role of the healthcare providers in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.Sailor’s Lip,” or actinic cheilitis (AC), is a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) found on the lips. Similar to actinic keratosis, actinic cheilitis is a premalignant lesion caused by chronic sun exposure. It is most common on the lower lip along the vermillion border. Given SCC on the lips is considered a high-risk form of skin cancer with an 11% chance of metastasis compared to 1% for other body locations.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis is a diagnosis made from clinical and histopathology evaluation. It is essential to distinguish between cheilitis (benign inflammation), premalignant actinic cheilitis, and squamous cell carcinoma. Skin biopsy is the golden standard regarding the evaluation of a persistent suspicious lesion on the lip. Many lesions initially thought to be premalignant actinic cheilitis on exam were found to be SCC upon histological evaluation, which indicates providers are not able to entirely make the diagnosis clinically, and biopsy is helpful when evaluating these lesions. While not required to make a diagnosis, one article suggests evaluating patients with electron microscopy helps to assess further the ultrastructural changes found in AC lesions, their potential for malignant transformation, and ensure they are diagnosed and managed correctly.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis results from the sun or UV radiation exposure. Additional risk factors include increased age, especially over 60 years,The physical properties of the lips, such as their shape and being a transition area from oral mucosa to skin with thinner epithelium, less sebaceous glands, and less melanin, contribute to less protection and increased exposure to UV radiation. Chronic exposure to UV light damages tumor suppressor gene p53 resulting in uncontrolled replication of defective cells, which is a common gene mutation found with increasing frequency as actinic cheilitis and actinic keratoses undergo malignant transformation to SCC. Although actinic cheilitis can affect both the upper and lower oral cutaneous mucosa, more light from the sun hits the lower lip, making this area especially prone to sun damage and an increased number of skin cancers. Fitzpatrick I and II skin types, genetic abnormalities affecting pigmentation such as albinism.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis is the main precancerous lesion of the lip. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lip is reported together with oral carcinomas in the Brazilian official statistics. Overall, they account for 40% of the head and neck carcinomas. In general, physicians and dentists know little about what causes oral tumor development and progression. Tumor suppressor genes and cell proliferation regulatory proteins play a role in the progression of actinic cheilitis to squamous cell carcinoma and in its biological behavior. Knowledge on prognostic and diagnostic markers has a positive impact on the follow-up of these patients.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"An early diagnosis is of overwhelming importance for the management and prognosis of mucocutaneous cancer. Actinic cheilitis (AC), defined by the clonal expansion of genomically unstable keratinocytes, is the most common potentially malignant lesion affecting the lips. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most frequent oral malignancy, and there is strong evidence that the majority of the SCCs of the lip originate from AC. There is considerable difficulty in discerning between dysplasia and invasive carcinomas solely on a clinical basis. Although dermoscopy has become an essential tool for skin tumor evaluation, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a non-invasive imaging technology that has proved itself extremely useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of several skin diseases, including AC and SCC. The present study aimed to re-emphasize the usefulness of RCM in the early detection of malignant transformation, using AC and SCC of the lips as working examples.",,,,,,
3,actinic cheilitis,"Actinic cheilitis (AC), a potentially malignant lesion (1), is the most frequently occurring, and among the most important, of the pathological processes that affect the lips. At the same time, oral and lip malignancy is the eighth most prevalent neoplastic disorder worldwide (2), with men being at far greater risk compared with women (1.3% men vs. 0.3% women) (3–6). Although risk factors for carcinoma development are numerous [these include ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, smoking, premalignant lesions, several viruses, immunosuppression, and chronic trauma] (6,7), AC has been directly associated with chronic exposure to UV radiation, notably UVB radiation, due to its greater penetration potential when compared with UVA (8,9). Albeit that occupational UV radiation exposure is a major risk factor for AC in men, its association with smoking and unhealthy eating habits may produce synergistic effects",,,,,,

4,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Basal Cell Carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. Basal Cell Carcinoma begins in the basal cells — a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old ones die off.Basal Cell Carcinoma often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other forms. Basal Cell Carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as your head and neck.Most Basal Cell Carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against Basal Cell Carcinoma.Basal Cell Carcinoma usually develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. Less often, Basal Cell Carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals. Basal Cell Carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. ",,,,,,
4,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer and the most frequently occurring form of all cancers. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 3.6 million cases are diagnosed each year. BCCs arise from abnormal, uncontrolled growth of basal cells.Because BCCs grow slowly, most are curable and cause minimal damage when caught and treated early. Understanding BCC causes, risk factors and warning signs can help you detect them early, when they are easiest to treat and cure.BCC most often occurs when DNA damage from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or indoor tanning triggers changes in basal cells in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis), resulting in uncontrolled growth.BCCs can look like open sores, red patches, pink growths, shiny bumps, scars or growths with slightly elevated, rolled edges and/or a central indentation. At times, BCCs may ooze, crust, itch or bleed. The lesions commonly arise in sun-exposed areas of the body. ",,,,,,

4,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), previously known as basal cell epithelioma, is the most common cancer in Humans. BCC mostly arises on sun-damaged skin and rarely develops on the mucous membranes or palms and soles. Basal Cell Carcinoma is a slow-growing tumor for which metastases are rare. Although rarely fatal, BCC can be highly destructive and disfigure local tissues when treatment is inadequate or delayed. BCC usually appears as flesh- or pink-colored, pearly papules with overlying ulceration or telangiectatic vessels. BCC occurs on the head or neck in the majority of cases, but can involve the trunk and extremities.More than 26 different subtypes of BCC appear in the literature, the more common, distinctive, clinicopathologic types include: nodular, micronodular, superficial, morpheaform, infiltrative and fibroepithelial (also known as fibroepithelioma of Pinkus). Combinations of these types can occur as well. The majority of BCCs are amelanotic but few amounts of melanin may be present within these tumors.",,,,,,
4,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Basal and squamous cell skin cancers are the most common types of skin cancer. They start in the top layer of skin (the epidermis), and are often related to sun exposure.Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer cells.Basal Cell Carcinoma (also called basal cell skin cancer) is most common type of skin cancer. About 8 out of 10 skin cancers are Basal Cell Carcinomas (also called basal cell cancers).These cancers start in the basal cell layer, which is the lower part of the epidermisThese cancers usually develop on sun-exposed areas, especially the face, head, and neck. They tend to grow slowly. It’s very rare for a basal cell cancer to spread to other parts of the body. But if it's left untreated, basal cell cancer can grow into nearby areas and invade the bone or other tissues beneath the skin.If not removed completely, Basal Cell Carcinoma can come back (recur) in the same place on the skin.

4,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Basal Cell Carcinoma is a superficial, slowly growing papule or nodule that derives from certain epidermal cells. Basal Cell Carcinomas arise from keratinocytes near the basal layer, which are sometimes called basaloid keratinocytes. Metastasis is rare, but local growth can be highly destructive. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Treatment depends on the tumor’s characteristics and may involve curettage and electrodesiccation, surgical excision, cryosurgery, topical chemotherapy, or, occasionally, radiation therapy or drug therapy.Basal Cell Carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, with > 4 million new cases yearly in the United States. It is most common among fair-skinned people with a history of sun exposure and is very rare in darkly pigmented people.",,,,,,
4,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is a type of skin cancer that begins in the basal cells. Normal basal cells line the epidermis. They’re the skin cells that replace old cells with new ones. Cancer of the basal cells results in tumors that appear on the skin’s surface. These tumors often look like sores, growths, bumps, scars, or red patches.While BCC almost never spreads to other places in the body (metastasizes), it can still result in disfigurement. In rare cases, it can spread to other parts of the body. If it does, it can become life-threatening.BCC is the most common type of skin cancer. Approximately 4 million cases of it are diagnosed in the United States every year.Almost all BCCs develop on parts of the body frequently exposed to the sun.

4,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"BCC develops in the basal cells, which are round skin cells that lie deep in the skin’s epidermis below the squamous cells. They form the base layer of the epidermis, which meets the dermis.BCC is unlikely to spread, but doctors who suspect that an individual has this type of carcinoma will still refer them for further assessment.Squamous cells make up most of the top layer of the skin, which people refer to as the epidermis. These cells are flat and scale-like.Doctors who suspect SCC will provide a more urgent referral, as it is more likely than BCC to spread.Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight is the primary cause of carcinoma and other skin cancers.Some people are more sensitive to UV light than others and are more vulnerable to the effects of sunlight on cancer development. Additional UV exposure from tanning beds and UV drying lamps in nail salons, for example, can also add to a person’s risk.UV radiation can cause damage to the DNA in skin cells, leading to mutations during cell .",,,,,,

4,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Staging is the process of determining whether cancer has spread and, if so, how far. The stage of the disease may affect the treatment plan.The stage is based on the size of the tumor, how deeply into the skin it has grown, and whether cancer has spread beyond the tumor to the lymph nodes. Your doctor will look at the results of the biopsy to determine the stage. In rare cases, your doctor may recommend imaging such as CT or PET-CT scan to see if the cancer has spread beyond the skinStage 0. Cancer is found only in the original tumor in the skin.

5,bullous pemphigoid,"Pruritus is the first symptom of bullous pemphigoid. Skin lesions may not develop for several years. Often, characteristic tense bullae develop on skin of the trunk and in the flexural and intertriginous areas. Bullae may develop on normal-appearing skin or may be preceded by erythematous or urticarial-appearing plaques. Localized disease may occur at trauma sites, stomas, and anogenital and lower leg areas. Bullae usually do not rupture, but those that do often rapidly heal.Polymorphic, annular, dusky-red, edematous lesions, with or without peripheral vesicles, can occur. Rarely, small blisters develop on the mucosa. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia are common, but fever is rare. The Nikolsky sign, where upper layers of epidermis move laterally with slight pressure or rubbing of skin adjacent to a blister, is negative.",,,,,,
5,bullous pemphigoid,"If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, skin biopsy is done for histology and direct immunofluorescence testing. Samples from in and around the lesion itself are often used for histology, but samples of uninvolved skin (often about 3 mm from the edge of a lesion) are used for direct immunofluorescence. The blister in bullous pemphigoid is subepidermal, often containing many neutrophils and eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence shows linear IgG and complement deposits along the basement membrane zone (dermal–epidermal junction). Indirect immunofluorescence shows circulating IgG deposits on the epidermal side of a salt-split preparation of normal (ie, test substrate) skin.Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic, potentially fatal disease, particularly without treatment. Although topical and systemic therapies are helpful, they may cause adverse effects.Treatment of Bullous Pemphigoid Corticosteroids, topical or oralAnti-inflammatory drugsImmunosuppressant drugs or biologics",,,,,,
5,bullous pemphigoid,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a relatively common autoimmune vesicobullous disease encountered in India. It is a subepidermal bullous disorder most commonly seen in the elderly and manifests as tense blisters on urticarial base, predominantly over flexures, and is associated with pruritus. The diagnosis can be confirmed by histology, direct and indirect immunofluorescence. Several new diagnostic techniques have also been developed. Treatment of BP is based on the extent and rate of progression of the disease. Several topical and systemic anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents have been used with variable results.",,,,,,
5,bullous pemphigoid,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a subepidermal blistering skin disease that usually occurs in the elderly population and is characterized by large tense blisters with immunopathological findings of linear deposits of C3 and IgG at the basement membrane zone.Little is known about the epidemiology of BP. Previous studies have reported incidence between 0.2 and 3 per 100,000 person years. [1] In UK, a regional study estimated an incidence of 1.4 per 100,000 person years. Epidemiological data from India are lacking. Pemphigus vulgaris is more commonly encountered than BP in India.It primarily affects elderly individuals in the fifth to seventh decade of life, with average age of onset being 65 years. BP in childhood has been reported from various countries including India. [2] There is no known ethnic, racial, or sexual predilection.",,,,,,
5,bullous pemphigoid,"BP may present with several distinct clinical presentations and the onset may be either subacute or acute. The characteristic skin lesion is a large tense blister arising on erythematous base or on normal skin. These lesions are most common in the lower abdomen, inner or anterior thighs and flexor forearms, although they may occur anywhere. The bullae are usually filled with clear fluid but may be hemorrhagic. Significant pruritus is frequently present. In some patients, blisters arise after persistent urticarial lesions, and in some, urticarial lesions are the sole manifestations of the disease. Oral and ocular mucosal involvement rarely occurs. The bullae usually heal with post-inflammatory pigmentary changes and there is no scarring or milia formation.",,,,,,
5,bullous pemphigoid,"Bullous pemphigoid is a skin disease that causes blisters. It mainly affects people aged over 70. Treatment usually works well to control symptoms. Treatment is usually with steroid creams or medicines, but sometimes other medicines may be used. The condition tends to go away after 1-5 years and then treatment can be stopped. Sometimes the disease persists and treatment is needed long-termBullous pemphigoid is rare. In the UK it is estimated that between 4-5 people in 100,000 develop it each year. Most people with bullous pemphigoid are aged over 70. It is very rare in children. It can come on in pregnancy, when it is called gestational pemphigoid and requires careful management by a dermatologist and an obstetrician together. Bullous pemphigoid is not infectious and you cannot catch it from an affected person. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease. The immune system normally makes antibodies to attack bacteria, viruses, and other germs.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by the Borrelia bacterium which is spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans, that appears at the site of the tick bite about a week after it occurred.The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful.Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash.[1] Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and tiredness.[1] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others.[1] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur.[1] Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs.[1] Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and tiredness for at least six months.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and rarely, Borrelia mayonii. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system. Lyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g., rash), and the possibility of exposure to infected ticks. Laboratory testing is helpful if used correctly and performed with validated methods. Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated successfully with a few weeks of antibiotics. Steps to prevent Lyme disease include using insect repellent, removing ticks promptly, applying pesticides, and reducing tick habitat. The ticks that transmit Lyme disease can occasionally transmit other tickborne diseases as well.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is caused by bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi that are transmitted to humans through a bite from an infected black-legged or deer tick. Symptoms can occur anywhere from 3 to 30 days after the bite and can be wide-ranging, depending on the stage of the infection. In some cases, symptoms can appear months after the bite.The chances you might get Lyme disease from a tick bite depend on the kind of tick, where you were when the bite occurred, and how long the tick was attached to you, the CDC says. Black-legged ticks must be attached to you for 36 to 48 hours to transmit Lyme disease. Early signs and symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes -- all common in the flu. In up to 80% of Lyme infections, a rash is one of the first symptoms.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi is transmitted to humans by a bite from an infected black-legged or deer tick. The tick becomes infected after feeding on infected deer, birds, or mice.A tick has to be present on the skin for at least 36 hours to transmit the infection. Many people with Lyme disease have no memory of a tick bite.Lyme disease was first recognized in the town of Old Lyme, Connecticut, in 1975. It’s the most common tickborne illness in Europe and the United States.People who live or spend time in wooded areas known for transmission of the disease are more likely to get this illness. People with domesticated animals that visit wooded areas also have a higher risk of getting Lyme disease.",,,,,,

Also, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, pregnant women cannot transmit the disease to their fetus through their breast milk.Lyme disease is an infection caused by bacteria transmitted by blacklegged deer ticks. These bacteria are found in bodily fluids, but there’s no evidence that Lyme disease can be spread to another person through sneezing, coughing, or kissing.There is also no evidence that Lyme disease can be sexually transmitted or transmitted through a blood transfusion.Learn more about whether Lyme disease is contagious.Diagnosing Lyme disease begins with a review of your health history, which includes looking for reports of tick bites or residence in an endemic area.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is caused by four main species of bacteria. Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii cause Lyme disease in the United States, while Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading causes in Europe and Asia. The most common tick-borne illness in these regions, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a deer tick.A small, red bump, similar to the bump of a mosquito bite, often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days. This normal occurrence doesn't indicate Lyme disease.Only a minority of tick bites leads to Lyme disease. The longer the tick remains attached to your skin, the greater your risk of getting the disease. Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii, carried primarily by black-legged or deer ticks. Young brown ticks often are no bigger than a poppy seed, which can make them nearly impossible to spot.To contract Lyme disease, an infected deer tick must bite you. The bacteria enter your skin through the bite and eventually make their way into your bloodstream.In most cases, to transmit Lyme disease, a deer tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours. If you find an attached tick that looks swollen, it may have fed long enough to transmit bacteria. Removing the tick as soon as possible might prevent infection.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid areas where deer ticks live, especially wooded, bushy areas with long grass. You can decrease your risk of getting Lyme disease with some simple precautions:Cover up. When in wooded or grassy areas, wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves. Try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. Keep your dog on a leash.Use insect repellents. Apply insect repellent with a 20% or higher concentration of DEET to your skin. Parents should apply repellant to their children, avoiding their hands, eyes and mouth.Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully. Apply products with permethrin to clothing or buy pretreated clothing.Do your best to tick-proof your yard. Clear brush and leaves where ticks live. Mow your lawn regularly. Stack wood neatly in dry, sunny areas to discourage rodents that carry ticks.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the United States. The ticks pick up Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria from mice and deer and pass the bacteria to humans through their bites.At first, a rash may appear, and it may fade awayTrusted Source without treatment. In time, Lyme disease complications can affect the joints, heart, and nervous system.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) registered 23,558Trusted Source confirmed cases of Lyme disease in 2018. The highest rate was in Pennsylvania.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is caused by bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi (B burgdorferi). Blacklegged ticks (also called deer ticks) can carry these bacteria. Not all species of ticks can carry these bacteria. Immature ticks are called nymphs, and they are about the size of a pinhead. Nymphs pick up bacteria when they feed on small rodents, such as mice, infected with B burgdorferi. You can only get the disease if you are bitten by an infected tick.Lyme disease was first reported in the United States in 1977 in the town of Old Lyme, Connecticut. The same disease occurs in many parts of Europe and Asia. In the United States, most Lyme disease infections occur in the following areas:Northeastern states, from Virginia to MaineNorth-central states, mostly in Wisconsin and MinnesotaWest Coast, mainly in the northwest",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is medically described as occurring in three phases, each with distinctive symptoms. The first phase is early localized disease, which occurs three to 30 days after the tick bite that transmitted the infection. This stage is characterized by skin inflammation. The rash that occurs is referred to as erythema migrans. It develops in about 70% of people who get Lyme disease. It starts at the site of the tick bite and expands over the next several days. It can eventually cover an area up to about 12 inches across. Some of the area may clear, giving the rash at times a bull's-eye appearance.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease, or borreliosis, is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected blacklegged deer tick. It is the most common tickborne infectious disease in the United States.  In patients who have non-specific symptoms after being treated for Lyme disease and who have no evidence of active infection (patients with PTLDS, post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome), studies have shown that more antibiotic therapy is not helpful and can be dangerous.Ticks can become infected with more than one disease-causing microbe (called co-infection). Co-infection may be a potential problem for humans, because the Ixodes ticks that transmit Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium which causes Lyme disease, often carry and transmit other pathogens, as well. A single tick could make a person sick with any one—or several—diseases at the same time.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is an infection spread by the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. In the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States, it is spread by Ixodes scapularis (or deer tick), and in the Pacfic coast, it is spread by the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus).If caught and treated early, the infection most often clears quickly. If not found until the later stages of infection, people with Lyme disease are more likely to have symptoms.Lyme disease results from the spread of Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria living inside infected ticks. These small ticks can attach to human skin and go unnoticed, feeding for a few days. During that time, the bacteria pass from the tick into the person, before the tick dislodges. Other infections spread by ticks may occur at the same time (co-infection) or separate from Lyme disease. These also require prompt medical care.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Treatment of Lyme disease is with certain antibiotics. In most cases, early-stage Lyme disease is treated successfully with two to three weeks of oral (by mouth) antibiotics. Most cases of early-stage Lyme disease need just two or three weeks of antibiotics, most experts agree. However, patients with arthritis (swelling of a joint) need longer treatment (four weeks) with oral antibiotics. If arthritis persists, they may need a second four-week course of oral or intravenous (often called IV) antibiotics. Infection involving the nervous system or heart also may require IV antibiotics.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks.Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and heath areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease are found throughout the UK and in other parts of Europe and North America.Lyme disease can often be treated effectively if it's detected early on. But if it's not treated or treatment is delayed, there's a risk you could develop severe and long-lasting symptoms.Many people with early-stage Lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite, usually around three to 30 days after being bitten. This is known as erythema migrans.The rash is often described as looking like a bull's-eye on a dart board. The affected area of skin will be red and the edges may feel slightly raised.The size of the rash can vary significantly and it may expand over several days or weeks. ",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease, tick-borne bacterial disease that was first conclusively identified in 1975 and is named for the town in Connecticut, U.S., in which it was first observed. The disease has been identified in every region of the United States and in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.In humans, Lyme disease progresses in three stages, though symptoms and severity of illness vary depending on which type of Borrelia is involved. In B. burgdorferi infections, the first and mildest stage is characterized by a circular rash in a bull’s-eye pattern that appears anywhere from a few days to a month after the tick bite. The rash is often accompanied by flulike symptoms, such as headache, fatigue, chills, loss of appetite, fever, and aching joints or muscles. The majority of persons who contract Lyme disease experience only these first-stage symptoms and never become seriously ill. A minority, however, will go on to the second stage of the disease, which begins two weeks to three months after infection.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease, a common vector-borne condition in the United States, is transmitted through infected deer ticks. Also known as Lyme borreliosis, it is a bacterial disease caused by the borrelia bacterium which is spread by the black-legged, Ixodes ticks which are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type.The small ticks feed on blood of birds and mice, and then bite humans, contaminating their blood. After the tick injects the bacteria into the blood, the bacteria grows locally which is called Early-localised disease. When it spreads into the blood it is called disseminated disease, which causes damage to various organs. Later, it causes various complication of the lymes disease.These ticks are found in shrubs, bushes and on wooded areas, and may get attached to the human host when they come in contact during outdoor activities.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted in the United States primarily by Ixodes scapularis (the deer tick), is the most common vectorborne disease in the United States. Its most frequent manifestation, a characteristic, expanding annular rash (ery-thema migrans), sometimes accompanied by myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise, occurs in nearly 90% of persons with symptomatic infection. Other manifestations of Lyme disease include seventh cranial nerve palsy, aseptic meningitis, and arthritis. Extensive coverage in the press about the serious effects of Lyme disease has led to widespread anxiety about this illness that is far out of proportion to the actual morbidity that it causes. This problem is exacerbated by the frequent use of serological tests to eliminate the possible diagnosis of Lyme disease in persons with only nonspecific symptoms (such as arthralgia or fatigue) who have a very low probability that Lyme disease is the cause of their symptoms. Consequently, misdiagnosis is frequent and is the most common cause of failure of treatment. The prognosis for most persons with Lyme disease is excellent.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease can affect people of any age. People who spend time outdoors in activities such as camping, hiking, golfing, or working or playing in grassy and wooded environments are at increased risk of exposure. The chances of being bitten by a deer tick are greater during times of the year when ticks are most active. Ticks can be active any time the temperature is above 45° F. Young deer ticks, called nymphs, are active from mid-May to mid-August and are about the size of poppy seeds. Adult ticks are most active from March to mid-May and from mid-August to November and are about the size of sesame seeds. Both nymphs and adults can spread Lyme disease. Infected deer ticks can be found throughout New York State.Lyme disease is an infection caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and is spread to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks (or deer ticks). Not all deer ticks are infected with the bacteria. Lyme disease can affect people of any age. ",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (also known as the deer tick or bear tick). The disease affects both humans and animals. The health department is monitoring the spread of the disease across the state and working with residents to limit exposure to the ticks causing the disease.Lyme disease is one of several tickborne diseases in Minnesota.In order to get Lyme disease, a person must be bitten by a blacklegged tick (also known as deer tick or bear tick) that is infected with the Lyme disease bacteria.On average, about 1 in 3 adult blacklegged ticks and 1 in 5 blacklegged tick nymphs (immature stage) are infected with Lyme disease bacteria.The tick must be attached for at least 24-48 hours to transmit the bacteria.The chance of getting Lyme disease increases the longer the tick is attached.",,,,,,
6,Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is a bacterial (Borrelia burgdorferi) infection transmitted to humans by the bite of certain black-legged ticks, although fewer than 50 percent of all Lyme disease patients recall a tick bite.Typical symptoms include fever, headache, and fatigue. Lyme disease can also lead to neurological symptoms, including loss of function in arms and legs. According to experts, standard diagnostic methods fail to discover as many as 40 percent of cases of Lyme disease.Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated successfully with antibiotics over several weeks. While some people with long-term Lyme disease take antibiotics over an extended course of time, most physicians do not consider it to be a chronic infection.According to published medical literature, many individuals diagnosed as having chronic Lyme disease demonstrate no evidence of prior infection. In fact, only 37 percent of patients in one referral center had current or previous infection with B. burgdorferi as the explanation for their symptoms.",,,,,,

Your rash can be itchy and uncomfortable, and it may bleed easily if you rub or pick it.",,,,,,
7,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a skin disorder that causes skin cells to multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. This makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. They can grow anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Psoriasis can't be passed from person to person. It does sometimes happen in members of the same family.Psoriasis usually appears in early adulthood. For most people, it affects just a few areas. In severe cases, psoriasis can cover large parts of the body. The patches can heal and then come back throughout a person's life.No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it’s a combination of things. Something wrong with the immune system causes inflammation, triggering new skin cells to form too quickly. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3 to 4 days. The buildup of old cells being replaced by new ones creates those silver scales.Psoriasis tends to run in families. ",,,,,,
7,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease* (a disease with an unclear cause that is characterized by inflammation caused by dysfunction of the immune system) that causes inflammation in the body. There may be visible signs of the inflammation such as raised plaques (plaques may look different for different skin types) and scales on the skin. This occurs because the overactive immune system speeds up skin cell growth. Normal skin cells completely grow and shed (fall off) in a month. With psoriasis, skin cells do this in only three or four days. Instead of shedding, the skin cells pile up on the surface of the skin. Some people report that psoriasis plaques itch, burn and sting. Plaques and scales may appear on any part of the body, although they are commonly found on the elbows, knees, and scalp.Inflammation caused by psoriasis can impact other organs and tissues in the body. People with psoriasis may also experience other health conditions. One in three people with psoriasis may also develop psoriatic arthritis. ",,,,,,

7,Psoriasis,"Plaque psoriasis, the most common type of psoriasis, usually starts as one or more small red, silvery, shiny patches (plaques) on the scalp, elbows, knees, back, or buttocks. The eyebrows, underarms, navel, the skin around the anus, and the cleft where the buttocks meet the lower back may also be affected. Many people with psoriasis may also have deformed, thickened, and pitted nails.The first patches may clear up after a few months or remain, sometimes growing together to form larger patches. Some people never have more than one or two small patches, and others have patches covering large areas of the body. Thick patches or patches on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or skinfolds of the genitals are more likely to itch or hurt, but many times the person has no symptoms. Although the patches do not cause extreme physical discomfort, they are very obvious and often embarrassing to the person. The psychologic distress caused by psoriasis can be severe.Psoriasis persists throughout life but may come and go. Symptoms of psoriasis are often diminished during the summer when the skin is exposed to bright sunlight. Some people may go for years between occurrences.Psoriasis may flare up for no apparent reason or as a result of a variety of circumstances. Flare-ups often result from conditions that irritate the skin, such as minor injuries and severe sunburn. Sometimes flare-ups occur after infections, such as colds and strep throat. Flare-ups are more common in the winter, after drinking alcohol, and after stressful situations. Many drugs, such as antimalarial drugs, lithium, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, terbinafine, interferon-alpha, and beta-blockers, can also cause psoriasis to flare up. Flare-ups are also more common among people who are obese, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or smoke tobacco.Doctors base the diagnosis of psoriasis on how the scales and plaques look and where they appear on the body.",,,,,,

7,Psoriasis,"The most common type, called plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris), is characterized by slightly elevated reddish patches or papules (solid elevations) covered with silvery white scales. In most cases, the lesions tend to be symmetrically distributed on the elbows and knees, scalp, chest, and buttocks. The lesions may remain small and solitary or coalesce into large plaques that often form geometrical patterns with a central area of normal skin. In many cases the nails become thickened, irregularly laminated, and brittle. In addition to plaque psoriasis, there are four other types of psoriasis, including guttate, pustular, inverse (or flexular), and erythrodermic.Psoriasis is an immune-mediated (or autoimmune) disorder that occurs when immune cells known as T lymphocytes, or T cells, attack healthy skin cells in both the nonvascular horny outer layer of the skin and its deeper vascular layer. This attack causes the life span of the skin cells to shorten to about 3 to 5 days (skin cells normally live about 20 to 28 days) and forces the cells to reproduce more rapidly than normal. Psoriasis occurs in both sexes with equal frequency, being most prevalent between the ages of 10 and 30. It is most often seen in northern climates. An estimated 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. population is affected by psoriasis. In contrast, between 0.05 and 0.3 percent of Asians experience the condition. In European countries the incidence of psoriasis is highly variable, affecting anywhere from less than 1 percent to more than 6 percent of populations.The onset of psoriasis is usually gradual but occasionally explosive. Precipitating factors may include injury to the skin, acute infection, and psychological upsets. Ordinarily, the lesions become less severe and sometimes disappear during the summer, possibly owing to the effect of sunlight. The severe complications of psoriasis are extensive sloughing of the outer layer of the skin, with resulting inflammation, and psoriatic arthritis. Generally, however, individuals with psoriasis are in relatively good health. The variability in the progression and severity of the disorder has led researchers to suspect that the underlying causes of psoriasis are the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.There is no permanent cure for psoriasis, but there are a variety of treatments aimed at relieving the associated skin symptoms. Topical treatments for psoriasis come in different forms (e.g., creams and gels) and generally provide relief from inflammation and scaling. Some, such as retinoids (derivatives of vitamin A) and synthetic forms of vitamin D, work by slowing skin cell reproduction, whereas others, such as corticosteroids, coal-tar ointment, and salicylic acid, work by reducing inflammation. Psoriasis can also be treated with phototherapy, in which the skin is exposed to ultraviolet light. While phototherapy can be highly effective, it does have side effects, including pain, irregular pigmentation, and scarring. In addition, long-term treatments are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.",,,,,,

7,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a common skin condition with systemic considerations. The skin component is variable among patients, but the most common type, plaque psoriasis, consists of raised lesions covered with a variable amount of silvery scales most commonly seen on the elbows, knees, scalp, and trunk. Other types of psoriasis are guttate, inverse, pustular, scalp, erythrodermic, and psoriatic inflammatory arthritis.

Guttate psoriasis consists of drop-like lesions, usually with a sudden onset and commonly seen after a streptococcal pharyngitis infection and more commonly seen in children and young adults. This type may come and go and does not necessary mean that a patient will develop ongoing, chronic plaque-type psoriasis.

Inverse psoriasis is a type of psoriasis where the scaly plaques develop in skin fold areas like the axillae, groin and buttock creases and the folds under the breasts. Because of the heat and skin-on-skin friction at these sites, the scales tend to be rubbed off and all that remains is shiny red smooth areas that look like scalded skin.Erythrodermic psoriasis very often occurs after a stressful event in the body as a whole, such as an infection, fever, or other significant illness. Patients with this type of psoriasis report that the skin becomes bright red all over, with or without significant scaling. Nail changes including loss of nails may be seen with this type of psoriasis. Fevers and chills may accompany this form of psoriasis. With significant involvement of the skin, patients with erythrodermic psoriasis may need to be treated in a burn unit because of loss of fluid, electrolytes, protein, and disruption of normal body hemostasis functions.Three types of pustular psoriasis exist: von Zumbusch, palmoplantar pustulosis, and acropustulosis (acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau). Pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch appears as a distinctive acute form of psoriasis that develops after a significant fever and manifests itself with crops of sterile pustules over the trunk and extremities. These pustules develop in clusters on top of bright red skin. These clusters of pustules usually coalesce into larger areas as the disease progresses. Patients tend to have waxing and waning of the fever with pustules developing throughout the flare. The face, as with most types of psoriasis, is usually spared.  Palmoplantar pustulosis develops as multiple sterile pustules on the palms and soles that eventually turn brown, peel and crust over with repeated episodes occurring. Smoking can aggravate all types of psoriasis, but palmoplantar pustulosis is particularly common among smokers. Acropustulosis is manifested by skin lesions at the end of the fingers and toes starting after an injury to the skin or infection. These lesions can be quite painful and may cause deformity of the nails.  With severe causes the inflammation can be severe enough to cause boney changes.Some patients will develop only scalp involvement and this type of psoriasis can often be misdiagnosed as seborrhea (cradle cap) or tinea (fungal/ringworm). Generally there is a family history of psoriasis that can help with the diagnosis, and the scale of scalp psoriasis is usually more white/silvery than the waxy, off-white/yellowish scale of seborrhea.

Because psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory condition, some patients may develop psoriatic arthritis, with or without skin lesions. There is usually asymmetrical joint involvement and patients may have only a few joints (oligoarthritis) involved.

Psoriasis is often considered a skin condition, but in fact is a systemic disease resulting from a malfunction of the immune system, more specifically, over active/stimulated T-cells, a type of white blood cell involved in inflammatory activities. These overactive T cells trigger other immune responses that cause increased blood flow and inflammation in the areas of involvement with resultant increases in skin growth. The increased growth of skin cells cannot be sloughed off in a timely manner and an increased thickness (plaque) of skin develops. This cycle repeats itself (unless treatments intervene) and continued scale and plaques develop.

Psoriasis is controllable, but not curable. Many things can trigger the onset and continuation of psoriasis:

Bacterial and viral infections
Stress: emotional or frictional on the skin surface inducing new areas of psoriasis and aggravating existing plaques
Medications: beta-blockers, lithium, antimalarial medications, prednisone and other oral steroids
Injury to the skin: intentional such as with surgery, or unintentional such as a cut or scrape
Dry skin: may lead to scratching of the skin
Too little sunlight and even too much sunlight causing a sunburn",,,,,,
7,Psoriasis," A reddish, scaly rash often located over the surfaces of the elbows, knees, scalp, and around or in the ears, navel, genitals or buttocks. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that is mediated by T lymphocytes. It is also a very common disease, Chronic plaque psoriasis affects approximately 2% of people around the world. About 10% to 15% of patients with psoriasis develop joint inflammation (inflammatory arthritis). Treatment options include topical steroid creams, topical vitamin D derivatives, other medications, injections of biologic agents, and exposure to ultraviolet light.Psoriasis is a genetically programmed inflammatory disease that primarily affects the skin in about 3% of people in the United States. Psoriasis is characterized by skin cells that multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. When these cells reach the surface and die, raised, red plaques form that are covered with white scales. Psoriasis begins as a small scaling papule. When multiple papules coalesce, they form scaling plaques. These plaques tend to occur in the scalp, elbows, and knees",,,,,,
7,Psoriasis,"Although psoriatic plaques can be limited to only a few small areas, the condition can involve widespread areas of skin anywhere on the body. Psoriasis symptoms vary depending on the type of psoriasis you have. Common psoriasis symptoms can include the following:

Red patches of skin covered with silvery scales
Small scaling spots
Dry, cracked skin
Itching, burning, or soreness
Itchy plaques
Small bleeding points when the scale is peeled away",,,,,,
7,Psoriasis,"Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis and it gets its name from the plaques that build up on the skin. There tend to be well-defined patches of red raised skin that can appear on any area of the skin, but the knees, elbows, scalp, trunk, and nails are the most common locations. There is also a flaky, white buildup on top of the plaques called scales. Possible plaque psoriasis symptoms include skin pain, itching, and cracking.

There are plenty of over-the-counter products that are effective in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. 1% hydrocortisone cream is a topical steroid that can suppress mild disease and preparations containing tar are effective in treating plaque psoriasis.",,,,,,
7,Psoriasis,"Scalp psoriasis is a common skin disorder that makes raised, reddish, often scaly patches. Scalp psoriasis can affect your whole scalp, or just pop up as one patch. This type of psoriasis can even spread to the forehead, the back of the neck, or behind the ears. Scalp psoriasis symptoms may include only slight, fine scaling. Moderate to severe scalp psoriasis symptoms may include dandruff-like flaking, dry scalp, and hair loss. Scalp psoriasis does not directly cause hair loss, but stress and excess scratching or picking of the scalp may result in hair loss.

Scalp psoriasis can be treated with medicated shampoos, creams, gels, oils, ointments, and soaps. Salicylic acid and coal tar are two medications in over-the-counter products that help treat scalp psoriasis. Steroid injections and phototherapy may help treat mild scalp psoriasis. Biologics are the latest class of medications that can also help treat severe scalp psoriasis.",,,,,,
7,Psoriasis,"Guttate psoriasis looks like small, pink dots or drops on the skin. The word guttate is from the Latin word ""gutta,"" meaning drop. There tend to be fine scales with guttate psoriasis that are finer than the scales in plaque psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis is typically triggered by streptococcal infection (strep throat) and the outbreak will usually occur two to three weeks after having strep throat.

Guttate psoriasis tends to go away after a few weeks without treatment. Moisturizers can be used to soften the skin. If there is a history of psoriasis, a doctor may take a throat culture to determine if strep throat is present. If the throat culture shows that Streptococcus is present, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics.",,,,,,
7,Psoriasis,"Many patients with psoriasis have abnormal nails. Psoriatic nails often have a horizontal white or yellow margin at the tip of the nail called distal onycholysis because the nail is lifted away from the skin. There can often be small pits in the nail plate, and the nail is often yellow and crumbly.

The same treatment for skin psoriasis is beneficial for nail psoriasis. However, since nails grow slowly, it may take a while for improvements to be seen. Nail psoriasis can be treated with phototherapy, systemic therapy (medications that spread throughout the body), and steroids (cream or injection). If medications do not improve the condition of nail psoriasis, a doctor may surgically remove the nail.",,,,,,
7,Psoriasis,"Can present with sharply demarcated raised dry  red scaly patches commonly over elbows, knees,trunk  ,scalp. Can affect any part of the body. The scaling is like dandruff with bigger patches. Lesions can be small 1cm to bigger patches. Can affect joints especially finger joints. Psoriasis can develop wherever there is trauma/scratch. Increases during winter season. Stress, hormones, alcohol, smoking, few drugs aggravate psoriasis.
",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo (vit-ih-LIE-go) is a disease that causes loss of skin color in patches. The discolored areas usually get bigger with time. The condition can affect the skin on any part of the body. It can also affect hair and the inside of the mouth.

Normally, the color of hair and skin is determined by melanin. Vitiligo occurs when cells that produce melanin die or stop functioning. Vitiligo affects people of all skin types, but it may be more noticeable in people with darker skin. The condition is not life-threatening or contagious. It can be stressful or make you feel bad about yourself.

Treatment for vitiligo may restore color to the affected skin. But it doesn't prevent continued loss of skin color or a recurrence.Vitiligo signs include:

Patchy loss of skin color, which usually first appears on the hands, face, and areas around body openings and the genitals
Premature whitening or graying of the hair on your scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows or beard
Loss of color in the tissues that line the inside of your mouth and nose (mucous membranes)
Vitiligo can start at any age, but usually appears before age 30.

Depending on the type of vitiligo you have, it may affect:

Nearly all skin surfaces. With this type, called universal vitiligo, the discoloration affects nearly all skin surfaces.
Many parts of your body. With this most common type, called generalized vitiligo, the discolored patches often progress similarly on corresponding body parts (symmetrically).
Only one side or part of your body. This type, called segmental vitiligo, tends to occur at a younger age, progress for a year or two, then stop.
One or only a few areas of your body. This type is called localized (focal) vitiligo.
The face and hands. With this type, called acrofacial vitiligo, the affected skin is on the face and hands, and around body openings, such as the eyes, nose and ears.
It's difficult to predict how your disease will progress. Sometimes the patches stop forming without treatment. In most cases, pigment loss spreads and eventually involves most of your skin. Occasionally, the skin gets its color back.

",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo is a long-term skin condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment.[1] The patches of skin affected become white and usually have sharp margins.[1] The hair from the skin may also become white.[1] The inside of the mouth and nose may also be involved.[2] Typically both sides of the body are affected.[1] Often the patches begin on areas of skin that are exposed to the sun.[2] It is more noticeable in people with dark skin.[2] Vitiligo may result in psychological stress and those affected may be stigmatized.[1]

The exact cause of vitiligo is unknown.[1] It is believed to be due to genetic susceptibility that is triggered by an environmental factor such that an autoimmune disease occurs.[1][2] This results in the destruction of skin pigment cells.[2] Risk factors include a family history of the condition or other autoimmune diseases, such as hyperthyroidism, alopecia areata, and pernicious anemia.[2] It is not contagious.[4] Vitiligo is classified into two main types: segmental and non-segmental.[1] Most cases are non-segmental, meaning they affect both sides; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically expands with time.[1] About 10% of cases are segmental, meaning they mostly involve one side of the body; and in these cases, the affected area of the skin typically does not expand with time.[1] Diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue biopsy.[2]

There is no known cure for vitiligo.[1] For those with light skin, sunscreen and makeup are all that is typically recommended.[1] Other treatment options may include steroid creams or phototherapy to darken the light patches.[2] Alternatively, efforts to lighten the unaffected skin, such as with hydroquinone, may be tried.[2] Several surgical options are available for those who do not improve with other measures.[2] A combination of treatments generally has better outcomes.[3] Counselling to provide emotional support may be useful.[1]

Globally about 1% of people are affected by vitiligo.[3] In some populations it affects as many as 2–3%.[5] Males and females are equally affected.[1] About half show the disorder before age 20 and most develop it before age 40.[1] Vitiligo has been described since ancient history.[1]The only sign of vitiligo is the presence of pale patchy areas of depigmented skin which tend to occur on the extremities.[6][7] Some people may experience itching before a new patch occurs.[8] The patches are initially small, but often grow and change shape.[6][9] When skin lesions occur, they are most prominent on the face, hands and wrists.[6][7] The loss of skin pigmentation is particularly noticeable around body orifices, such as the mouth, eyes, nostrils, genitalia and umbilicus.[6][7] Some lesions have increased skin pigment around the edges.[10] Those affected by vitiligo who are stigmatized for their condition may experience depression and similar mood disorders.[11]",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo is a condition in which white patches develop on the skin. Any location on the body can be affected, and most people with vitiligo have white patches on many areas.

Vitiligo Causes and Risk Factors
The skin doesn't have its characteristic color because it has lost its melanin. For some reason, the pigment-forming cells known as melanocytes have been destroyed.

We don't know why this happens. It might be an autoimmune condition, where your body's defenses turn on your own cells instead of attacking invading germs.

Although vitiligo affects all races equally, it's more noticeable in dark-skinned people.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"You'll often lose pigment quickly on several areas of your skin. After the white patches appear, they may stay the same for a while, but later on, they might get bigger. You may have cycles of pigment loss and stability.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Body folds (like armpits)
Places that have been injured in the past
Areas exposed to sun
Around moles
Around body openings
Mucous membranes (tissues that line your nose and mouth)
It can also affect eyelids and hair.

It's rare for pigment to return once the white patches have developed.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo is a chronic (long-lasting) disorder that causes areas of skin to lose color. When skin cells that make color are attacked and destroyed, the skin turns a milky-white color. 

No one knows what causes vitiligo, but it may be an autoimmune disease. In people with autoimmune diseases, the immune cells attack the body’s own healthy tissues by mistake, instead of viruses or bacteria.

A person with vitiligo sometimes may have family members who also have the disease. There is no cure for vitiligo, but treatment may help skin tone appear more even.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. It's caused by the lack of melanin, which is the pigment in skin.

Vitiligo can affect any area of skin, but it commonly happens on the face, neck and hands, and in skin creases.

The pale areas of skin are more vulnerable to sunburn, so it's important to take extra care when in the sun and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF).

Symptoms of vitiligo
The areas of skin most commonly affected by vitiligo include:

mouth and eyes
fingers and wrists
armpits
groin
genitals
inside your mouth
It can also sometimes develop where there are hair roots, such as on your scalp. The lack of melanin in your skin can turn the hair in the affected area white or grey.

Vitiligo often starts as a pale patch of skin that gradually turns completely white. The centre of a patch may be white, with paler skin around it. If there are blood vessels under the skin, the patch may be slightly pink, rather than white.

The edges of the patch may be smooth or irregular. They're sometimes red and inflamed, or there's brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation).

Vitiligo does not cause discomfort to your skin, such as dryness, but the patches may occasionally be itchy.

The condition varies from person to person. Some people only get a few small, white patches, but others get bigger white patches that join up across large areas of their skin.

There's no way of predicting how much skin will be affected. The white patches are usually permanent.

Types of vitiligo
There are 2 main types of vitiligo:

non-segmental vitiligo
segmental vitiligo
In rare cases, it's possible for vitiligo to affect your whole body. This is known as universal or complete vitiligo.

Non-segmental vitiligo
Picture of non-segmental vitiligo on brown skinCredit:
In non-segmental vitiligo (also called bilateral or generalised vitiligo), the symptoms often appear on both sides of your body as symmetrical white patches.

Symmetrical patches can appear on the:

backs of your hands
arms
skin around body openings, such as the eyes
knees
elbows
feet
Non-segmental vitiligo is the most common type of vitiligo, affecting around 9 in 10 people with the condition.

Segmental vitiligo
Picture of a woman with segmental vitiligo affecting the faceCredit:
In segmental vitiligo (also known as unilateral or localised vitiligo), the white patches only affect one area of your body.

Segmental vitiligo is less common than non-segmental vitiligo, although it's more common in children. It usually starts earlier and affects 3 in 10 children with vitiligo.

What causes vitiligo?
Vitiligo is caused by the lack of a pigment called melanin in the skin. Melanin is produced by skin cells called melanocytes, and it gives your skin its colour.

In vitiligo, there are not enough working melanocytes to produce enough melanin in your skin. This causes white patches to develop on your skin or hair. It's not clear exactly why the melanocytes disappear from the affected areas of skin.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"It's possible that vitiligo may be triggered by particular events, such as:

stressful events, such as childbirth
skin damage, such as severe sunburn or cuts (this is known as the Koebner response)
exposure to certain chemicals – for example, at work
Vitiligo is not caused by an infection and you cannot catch it from someone else who has it.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo can sometimes cause other problems.

Because of a lack of melanin, your skin will be more vulnerable to the effects of the sun. Make sure you use a strong sunscreen to avoid sunburn.

Vitiligo may also be associated with eye problems, such as inflammation of the iris, inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (uveitis), and a partial loss of hearing (hypoacusis).

Problems with confidence and self-esteem are common in people with vitiligo, particularly if it affects areas of skin that are frequently exposed.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo is an acquired depigmenting disorder of the skin, in which pigment cells (melanocytes) are lost. It presents with well-defined milky-white patches of skin (leukoderma). Vitiligo can be cosmetically very disabling, particularly in people with dark skin.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo affects 0.5–1% of the population, and occurs in all races. It may be more common in India than elsewhere, with reports of up to 8.8% of the population affected. In 50% of sufferers, pigment loss begins before the age of 20, and in about 80% it starts before the age of 30 years. In 20%, other family members also have vitiligo. Males and females are equally affected.

Even though most people with vitiligo are in good general health, they face a higher risk of having autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, thyroid disease (in 20% of patients over 20 years with vitiligo), pernicious anaemia (B12 deficiency), Addison disease (adrenal gland disease), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and alopecia areata (round patches of hair loss).

A vitiligo-like leukoderma may occur in patients with metastatic melanoma. It can also be induced by certain drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) used to treat metastatic melanoma. Vitiligo is also three times more common in haematology patients that have had allogeneic bone marrow and stem-cell transplants, than in the healthy population.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo can affect any part of the body. Complete loss of pigment can affect a single patch of skin, or it may affect multiple patches. Small patches or macules are sometimes described as confetti-like.

Common sites are exposed areas (face, neck, eyelids, nostrils, fingertips and toes), body folds (armpits, groin), nipples, navel, lips and genitalia.
Vitiligo also favours sites of injury (cuts, scrapes, acne, thermal burns and sunburn). This is called the Koebner phenomenon.
New-onset vitiligo also sometimes follows emotional stress.
Vitiligo may occasionally start as multiple halo naevi.
Loss of colour may also affect the hair on the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes and body. White hair is called ‘leukotrichia’ or ‘poliosis’.
The retina at the back of the eye may also be affected. However, the colour of the iris does not change.
The colour of the edge of the white patch can vary.

It is usually the colour of unaffected skin, but sometimes it is hyperpigmented or hypopigmented.
The term trichrome vitiligo is used to describe three shades of skin colour. Very rarely, there are four shades of pigment (white, pale brown, dark brown and normal skin).
Occasionally, each patch of vitiligo has an inflamed, red border.
The severity of vitiligo differs with each person. There is no way to predict how much pigment an individual will lose or how fast it will be lost.

Vitiligo appears more evident in patients with naturally dark skin.
Extension of vitiligo can occur over a few months, then it stabilises.
Some spontaneous repigmentation may occur. Brown spots arise from the hair follicles, and the overall size of the white patch may reduce.
At some time in the future, the vitiligo begins to extend again.
Cycles of pigment loss followed by periods of stability may continue indefinitely.
Light skinned people usually notice the pigment loss during the summer as the contrast between the affected skin and suntanned skin becomes more distinct.
The pigment has occasionally been reported to be lost from the entire skin surface.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo usually begins with a few small white patches that may gradually spread over the body over the course of several months. Vitiligo typically begins on the hands, forearms, feet, and face but can develop on any part of the body, including the mucous membranes (moist lining of the mouth, nose, genital, and rectal areas), the eyes, and inner ears.

Sometimes the larger patches continue to widen and spread, but usually they stay in the same place for years. The location of smaller macules shifts and changes over time, as certain areas of skin lose and regain their pigments. Vitiligo varies in the amount of skin affected, with some patients experiencing few depigmented areas and others with widespread loss of skin color.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo can be:

Generalized, which is the most common type, when macules appear in various places on the body.
Segmental, which is restricted to one side of the body or one area, such as the hands or face.
Mucosal, which affects mucous membranes of the mouth and/or the genitals.
Focal, which is a rare type in which the macules are in a small area and do not spread in a certain pattern within one to two years.
Trichome, which means that there is a white or colorless center, then an area of lighter pigmentation, and then an area of normally colored skin.
Universal, another rare type of vitiligo, and one in which more than 80% of the skin of the body lacks pigment.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo occurs in about 1% or slightly more of the population throughout the world. Vitiligo affects all races and genders equally; however, it is more visible in people with darker skin. Although vitiligo can develop in anyone at any age, it most commonly appears in people ages 10 to 30 years. Vitiligo rarely appears in the very young or very old.

",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"What causes vitiligo?
Although the causes of vitiligo aren’t completely understood, there are a number of different theories:

Autoimmune disorder: The affected person’s immune system may develop antibodies that destroy melanocytes.
Genetic factors: Certain factors that may increase the chance of getting vitiligo can be inherited. About 30% of vitiligo cases run in families.
Neurogenic factors: A substance that is toxic to melanocytes may be released at nerve endings in the skin.
Self-destruction: A defect in the melanocytes causes them to destroy themselves.
Vitiligo may also be triggered by certain events, such as physical or emotional stress. Because none of the explanations seem to completely account for the condition, it’s possible that a combination of these factors is responsible for vitiligo.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Vitiligo is not painful. However, you can get painful sunburns on the lighter patches of skin. It is important to protect yourself against the sun with measures like using sunscreen, staying out of the sun during the hours that it is strongest, and wearing protective clothing.

8,vitiligo,"Signs and symptoms of vitiligo include the following:

Patches of skin lose color. This can include the eyes and/or the mucous membranes in your mouth or nose.
Patches of hair on your head or face turn prematurely gray or white.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Although vitiligo is mainly a cosmetic condition, people with vitiligo may experience a variety of problems:

Because they lack melanocytes, macules are more sensitive to sunlight than the rest of the skin, so they will burn rather than tan.
People with vitiligo may have some abnormalities in their retinas (the inner layer of the eye that contains light-sensitive cells) and some variation of color in their irises (the colored part of the eye). In some cases, there is some inflammation of the retina or iris, but vision is usually not affected.
People with vitiligo may be more likely to get other autoimmune diseases (in which the body’s immune system causes it to attack itself), such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, pernicious anemia, Addison’s disease, and alopecia areata. Also, people with autoimmune diseases are more at risk for developing vitiligo.
People with vitiligo may feel embarrassed or anxious about their skin. Sometimes people are rude – they may stare or say unkind things. This could cause a person with vitiligo to develop low self-esteem. This in turn could create anxiety or depression issues and make someone want to isolate. If this happens, you should talk to your healthcare provider or your family and friends to help you find a solution",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"Usually the white patches are easily visible on the skin, but healthcare providers can use a Wood’s lamp, which shines ultraviolet (UV) light onto the skin to help differentiate from other skin conditions.",,,,,,
8,vitiligo,"There are other conditions that make the skin change or lose pigmentation. These include:

Chemical leukoderma: Exposure to some industrial chemicals cause damage to the skin cells, resulting in linear or splotchy white areas of skin
Tinea versicolor: This yeast infection can create dark spots that show on light skin, or light spots that show on darker skin.
Albinism: This genetic condition means that you have lower levels of melanin in the skin, hair and/or eyes.

    It may also grow quickly. Sometimes keloids spread fast, and may, for example, triple in size in as little as a few months.
    Your scar is itchy, tender, or painful. These symptoms usually stop once the keloid is developed.
    Your scar is easily irritated. It may become irritated from friction, such as rubbing against clothing.
    It gradually turns darker. A keloid typically begins as a pink, red, or flesh-colored scar that darkens over time and ends up looking darker than the skin around the scar.
Keloids can occur anywhere — but, according to the AAD, they’re less common on the eyelids, genitals, soles of the feet, or palms of the hands.They fre

Keloids can form on the:
    neck
    ears
    chest
    back
    shoulders
Keloid scars form months after the injury responsible. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) observe that it may take 3–12 months for a keloid to become noticeable.
Keloids usually grow larger than the wound that caused them.
These scars may feel itchy or sore while they are growing, but the symptoms stop when the keloid stops developing.

18,keloid,"Keloid is an overgrowth of the scar tissue that develops around a wound, usually after the wound has healed. It expands far beyond the original scar. Rather than stay in a straight line, for example, after a surgical incision, it spreads outwards. Keloid scars are more common in people with darker skins, especially Afro-Caribbean races. The peak age is 10-30 years and keloids are less common in the elderly or babies. Studies of African people have shown that 6-16 out of a hundred develop keloids. Half of people with keloids will have other members of the family who have also developed keloids.    They are usually smooth, slightly shiny, firm skin growths.
    When they are growing they can feel itchy, prickly or sore.

18,keloid,"Keloid, also known as keloid disorder and keloidal scar,[1] is the formation of a type of scar which, depending on its maturity, is composed mainly of either type III (early) or type I (late) collagen. It is a result of an overgrowth of granulation tissue (collagen type 3) at the site of a healed skin injury which is then slowly replaced by collagen type 1. Keloids are firm, rubbery lesions or shiny, fibrous nodules, and can vary from pink to the color of the person's skin or red to dark brown in color.Keloids expand in claw-like growths over normal skin.[3] They have the capability to hurt with a needle-like pain or to itch, the degree of sensation varying from person to person.
Keloids form within scar tissue. Collagen, used in wound repair, tends to overgrow in this area, sometimes producing a lump many times larger than that of the original scar. They can also range in color from pink to red.[4] Although they usually occur at the site of an injury, keloids can also arise spontaneously. They can occur at the site of a piercing and even from something as simple as a pimple or scratch. They can occur as a result of severe acne or chickenpox scarring, infection at a wound site, repeated trauma to an area, excessive skin tension during wound closure or a foreign body in a wound. Keloids can sometimes be sensitive to chlorine. If a keloid appears when someone is still growing, the keloid can continue to grow as well. Keloids can develop in any place where skin trauma has occurred. They can be the result of pimples, insect bites, scratching, burns, or other skin injury. Keloid scars can develop after surgery. They are more common in some sites, such as the central chest (from a sternotomy), the back and shoulders (usually resulting from acne), and the ear lobes (from ear piercings). They can also occur on body piercings. The most common spots are earlobes, arms, pelvic region, and over the collar bone. ",,,,,,

Soon reddish or purplish slightly swollen lines develop perpendicular to the direction of skin tension (striae rubrae). Over time, these lighten to become whitish or flesh-coloured and much less conspicuous (striae albae). Stretch marks are usually several centimetres long and 1–10 mm wide.",,,,,,
20,Striae,"Striae, or stretch marks, are indented streaks that often affect the abdomen, buttocks, thighs, back, breasts, axillae and groin. The initial striae rubrae are slightly raised pink or violaceous linear marks (striae rubrae), which fade over months to years to hypopigmented, atrophic, wrinkled scars (striae albae). The marks are perpendicular to the direction of skin tension. They fade with time. In pregnancy, they occur on the abdomen, breasts, and thighs. In adolescents, they are common on thighs, buttocks, breasts (females) and back (males).",,,,,,

20,Striae,"Striae usually present clinically as 1-10mm-wide skin lines, measuring up to several centimetres. They are most often multiple and tend to have a symmetrical distribution. Stretch marks most often occur in body sites where the skin is subjected to increased stretching, like the abdomen, breasts, buttocks, thighs, arms and lower back. Steroid-related striae (e.g.: corticosteroid therapy; Cushing syndrome) can be wider, larger and widely distributed, possibly affecting other skin sites.

 “Striae rubra”, which are the first presentation of stretch marks, can be pink to red to violaceous in colour. Over several months, they evolve into “striae alba”, by lightening into white or flesh-coloured, scar-like lines of thinned and depressed skin, that are persistent and can worsen with aging. In dark-skinned people, striae may be grey-black or bluish in colour.

Although recent striae can be slightly itchy, these skin lesions are typically asymptomatic. They can, however, cause psychological distress, particularly if very pronounced or disfiguring.",,,,,,

26,prurigo_nodularis,"causes hard, itchy lumps (nodules) to form on the skin.The itching (pruritus) can be intense, causing people to scratch themselves to the point of bleeding or pain. Scratching can cause more skin lesions to appear.The itching is worsened by heat, sweating, or irritation from clothing.The main symptom of prurigo nodularis (PN) is the formation of hard, very itchy lumps (nodules) on the skin. The nodules can range in size from very small to about half an inch in diameter. The nodules often have a rough, dry top and can range in number from a few to hundreds. Nodules most commonly form on the outer arms, shoulders, and legs. Nodules can also form on the neck and trunk, and they rarely form on the face and palms. They may be lighter or darker in color than the surrounding skin. Scarring may occur after nodules begin to heal.
The symptoms of PN can begin at any age but are most common in adults between 20-60 years. People who have PN may become very concerned about the appearance of the nodules, and the intensely itchy skin may interfere with sleep or with everyday activities.",,,,,,

Excoriated lesions are often flat, umbilicated, or have a crusted top.
Nodules may appear to begin in the hair follicles.
Nodule pattern may be follicular.

It may appear as a small, red itchy bump about half an inch to about two centimeters in diameter, with crusting and scale in recently scratched lesions which then turn to darker and paler compared to surrounding skin.

The skin between the nodules is usually dry with itching so intense that patient keeps on scratching it for hours on end which sometimes leads to secondary infection.

Repetitive scratching, picking, rubbing may lead to permanent changes to the skin like nodular thickening (lichenification), hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation (dark pigmentation), and skin thickening in spots.

Scaly, crusted, scabbed and unhealed lesion are seen even after relieving the itch with medication. New nodules may keep on appearing but existing nodules may regress spontaneously leaving scars. This disease may run for a long time leading to stress and a lot of depression in patients.",,,,,,
