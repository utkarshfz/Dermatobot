dermatofironoma,"Typically, dermatofibromas are chronic and don’t spontaneously resolve on their own. Because they are harmless, treatment is usually solely for cosmetic reasons.

Treatment options for dermatofibromas include:

freezing (with liquid nitrogen)
localized corticosteroid injection
laser therapy
shaving the top to flatten the growth

Never attempt removal of a growth at home. This can lead to infection, scarring, and excess bleeding.
"
eczema asteatotic,"Consider factors that have caused dry skin: bathe less frequently, use a cream cleanser instead of soap, do not expose skin to direct heat.
Apply thick emollients and moisturisers such as petroleum jelly/petrolatum or oily cream several times daily — after a few days, thinner ones such as non-ionic cream should be adequate.
Apply mild topical steroid cream or ointment to reddened skin for a few days; hydrocortisone cream or ointment is often sufficient.
A more potent topical steroid may be necessary if the eczema is severe."
flexural psoriasis,"Calcipotriol cream is an effective and safe treatment for psoriasis in the flexures and should be applied twice daily. If it irritates, it can be applied once daily and hydrocortisone cream 12 hours later."
Foot corn,"The important thing is to relieve the pressure on the affected area of skin.

Choose well-fitting, comfortable, flat footwear.
Use leather gloves for repetitive tasks that injure the skin.
Apply a protective corn plaster or cushion to apply pressure more evenly around the affected area to reduce friction.
Separate toes using soft cotton, lamb's wool, moleskin or web spacers to relieve pressure.
Special orthotics may be made to measure.
Reduce skin thickness.

Sandpaper, file or pumice the surface (this is easier when the skin has been soaked in warm water for 10 minutes or longer).
Pare down the surface using a specially designed corn trimmer to remove the central core.
Apply keratolytic creams or heel balms containing urea, salicylic acid or lactic acid.
Ease the discomfort of painful cracks (fissures)

Apply a thick, lubricating ointment such as petroleum jelly.
Seal the surface with adhesive such as Liquid Bandage™ or nail glue.
Use antibiotic ointment in case of infection
Cover with a thick adhesive plaster."
melanocytic nevi,"Most melanocytic naevi are harmless and can be safely left alone. They may be removed in the following circumstances:

To exclude cancer
If a naevus is a nuisance: perhaps irritated by clothing, comb or razor
Cosmetic reasons: the mole is unsightly."
rosacea,"General measures
Where possible, reduce factors causing facial flushing.
Avoid oil-based facial creams. Use water-based make-up.
Never apply a topical steroid to the rosacea as although short-term improvement may be observed (vasoconstriction and anti-inflammatory effect), it makes the rosacea more severe over the next weeks (possibly by increased production of nitric oxide).
Protect yourself from the sun. Use light oil-free facial sunscreens.
Keep your face cool to reduce flushing: minimise your exposure to hot or spicy foods, alcohol, hot showers and baths and warm rooms.
Some people find they can reduce facial redness for short periods by holding an ice block in their mouth, between the gum and cheek

Metronidazole cream or gel can be used intermittently or long-term on its own for mild inflammatory rosacea and in combination with oral antibiotics for more severe cases.
Azelaic acid cream or lotion is also effective for mild inflammatory rosacea, applied twice daily to affected areas.
Brimonidine gel, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, and oxymetazoline hydrochloride cream, an alpha1A adrenoceptor agonist, reduce facial redness temporarily. 
Ivermectin cream can be used in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. It controls demodex mites and is anti-inflammatory.
"
seborrheic keratosis,"An individual seborrhoeic keratosis can easily be removed if desired. Reasons for removal may be that it is unsightly, itchy, or catches on clothing.

Methods used to remove seborrhoeic keratoses include:

Cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen) for thinner lesions (repeated if necessary)
Curettage and/or electrocautery
Ablative laser surgery
Shave biopsy (shaving off with a scalpel)
Focal chemical peel with trichloracetic acid
All methods have disadvantages. Treatment-induced loss of pigmentation is a particular issue for dark-skinned patients. There is no easy way to remove multiple lesions on a single occasion.
"
keloid,"    Some keloids respond to topically applied silicone sheeting.
    There has been some success in treating small earlobe keloids with pressure or ""clip-on"" earrings.
    Inflamed keloids often respond to steroid injections near the site. There is a risk of thinning of the skin (atrophy) with steroid injections. Alternative therapies include:

    Freezing (cryosurgery) plus steroid injections.
    Surgery plus radiation therapy to the affected area. Surgical removal (excision) of keloids may lead to the keloid coming back (recurring) larger than it was before the excision.
    Laser therapy with a pulsed-dye laser to actively expanding lesions.
    Other injectable agents, such as interferon alpha and gamma. "
boils," Applying warm compresses to the affected area on the patient for 20 minutes at least 3–4 times a day may ease the discomfort and help encourage the boil to drain. If the boil starts to drain, wash the area with antibacterial soap and apply some triple antibiotic ointment and a loose bandage. Repeat this process of cleansing and bandaging the area 2–3 times a day until the skin is healed.

Boils can be very contagious. Do not allow the patient to share clothing, towels, bedding, or sporting equipment with others while he or she has a boil. Wash your patient's hands frequently with antibacterial hand soap to avoid spreading the infection to others.

Have the patient use an antibacterial soap on boil-prone areas when showering, and dry the skin thoroughly after bathing. The patient should avoid tight-fitting clothing and activities that cause a great deal of sweating.

Do not pop the boil yourself or allow the patient to pop the boil with a pin or needle. Doing so may make the infection worse..The pus inside a boil needs to be drained thoroughly before the body can completely clear the infection. If the boil does not drain itself, maybe perform a simple procedure. In this procedure, a sterile needle or small blade is used to ""nick"" the skin over the top of the boil, and the pus is allowed to drain out. The area will then be cleaned and bandaged, and wash, apply antibacterial ointment, and re-bandage the area on the area several times daily as discussed above. The patient may also be prescribed a course of antibiotics to be taken by mouth. The pus for laboratory analysis and swabs from other areas of the body (nose, armpits, and/or anus and genital area) may need to be collected to determine if he or she is a carrier of staph. If the patient is a carrier, the doctor may prescribe a topical medication applied to the inside of the nose and/or oral antibiotics for several days. These measures can help to prevent a recurrence of the boil(s) and to decrease the possibility that the patient may unknowingly spread the germ to others. If your patient's doctor prescribes antibiotics, be sure the patient takes the full course of treatment."
Striae,"Stretch marks appearing during the teen years (adolescence) often improve in appearance with time. No treatment is needed.
Where applicable, stop using topical corticosteroid creams in the patient's skin area.
Over-the-counter creams are useless.
If the stretch marks are cosmetically distressing, early red areas can be treated. If the appearance of the early lesions is bothersome, tretinoin cream may improve the appearance. Laser treatments and chemical peels may also be used. If the diagnosis is not certain, a biopsy and blood tests might be done."
hives,"    Take cool showers
    Apply cool compresses
    Wear loose-fitting clothes
    Avoid strenuous activity
    Use an over-the-counter antihistamine such as diphenhydramine or loratadine

In addition, try to discover and avoid any triggers of your patient's hives. a detailed medical history and may do blood tests, urine tests, or X-rays.

Obviously, the best treatment for hives is to discover any triggers and stop your patient's exposure to them. However, most people with hives do not know the cause, and they require medications to get rid of the hives.

The most common medications for hives include:

    Sleep-causing (sedating) type-1 antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or cetirizine
    Non-sleep-causing (non-sedating) type-1 antihistamines such as loratadine, fexofenadine, or desloratadine
    Type-2 antihistamines such as anitidine, cimetidine, or famotidine
    Doxepin
    Montelukast, zafirlukast, or zileuton"
kerion,"A kerion is treated with oral antifungal medicines because the fungus grows deep into the hair follicle where topical creams and lotions cannot penetrate. Scalp ringworm and kerion usually require at least 6–8 weeks of treatment with oral antifungal pills or syrup, including:
    Griseofulvin
    Terbinafine
    Itraconazole
    Fluconazole
    Ketoconazole 
Often, the doctor will also prescribe a medicated shampoo to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to someone else:
    Selenium sulfide shampoo
    Ketoconazole shampoo
If the bacterial culture is positive (shows bacterial growth), the physician may want to start your patient on an oral antibiotic as well.
If the kerion is particularly tender and painful, your patient's doctor may recommend starting oral corticosteroids (cortisone pills or syrup). Steroids are strong medications that can quickly reduce the inflammation present in the kerion."
flea_bites,"The primary goal of therapy is to relieve the itching, which can be achieved by the following:

    Burow's solution compresses applied to the bites
    Calamine lotion to which 0.25% menthol may be added by the pharmacist
    1% hydrocortisone cream may take the edge off the itch

If flea bites have occurred indoors, all sources must be treated for effective flea control. Carpets, pet bedding, and all rooms should be thoroughly vacuumed, and pets should be treated separately.

Flea control at home may be regulated by the following measures:

    Bedding should be clean and laundered regularly.
    Bedrooms should be vacuumed regularly, especially in the corners underneath the beds.
    The indoor environment can be sprayed with a chemical used for flea infestation such as methoprene.
    A professional exterminator may be needed.
    Pets should be kept clean and regularly checked by a veterinarian.

Flea control for pets includes the following:

    Oral flea medication (available for dogs but not for cats)
    Monthly topical spot-on products 
    Flea collars    Prescription-strength mid- or high-potency topical corticosteroids can alleviate the severe itch.

Antihistamines may be prescribed for the relief of the itching. Be aware that some antihistamines cause drowsiness.

    Diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl®) – 25, 50 mg tablets or capsules, 25–50 mg nightly or every 6 hours as needed
    Cetirizine hydrochloride (Zyrtec®) – 10 mg tablets, 10 mg per day

Oral antibiotics may be necessary if secondary bacterial infection develops."
scabies,"Scabies requires prescription medication in order to stop the infestation. Once you are under a doctor's care, there are steps you can take to prevent scabies from coming back:

    Mites cannot survive off the human body for more than 48–72 hours. Therefore, wash all clothing, bedding, and towels used by the infested person in the past 72 hours in hot water, and dry these items in a hot dryer.
    Vacuum all carpets, rugs, and furniture, and discard the vacuum bags.
    Put anything that cannot be laundered into plastic bags for at least 72 hours.
    Pets do not need to be treated because the mite only lives on humans.

You can return to work or school the day after treatment is started.                  Your physician may be able to diagnose scabies simply by examining your skin for typical lesions, such as burrows. Your doctor may also diagnose scabies by gently scraping some skin onto a slide and looking with a microscope for mites, eggs, or mite feces.

In most cases of scabies, your doctor will prescribe a medicated cream or lotion to kill the infestation, such as:

    Permethrin 5% cream (Elimite®) – This is the first choice for treatment because it is very effective and safe. It is safe even for patientren and pregnant women. Rinse the cream off after 8–14 hours, and repeat in 7 days to kill recently hatched larvae.
    Crotamiton 10% lotion or cream (Eurax®, Crotan®) – This is not as effective as permethrin and can be irritating to the skin. Apply once daily for 5 consecutive days.
    Precipitated sulfur (5% or 10%) – This is prepared with petroleum jelly and is applied nightly for 3 consecutive nights. This is often the best choice for patientren aged younger than 2 years and for pregnant and lactating women because it is very safe to use. Unfortunately, it is greasy, has an odor, and can stain clothing.
    Lindane 1% solution – Lindane can be toxic to the nervous system. Therefore, avoid using it for young patientren and infants, pregnant or lactating women, and people with diseases affecting the nerves (neurological diseases). Apply to the body, rinse in 8 hours, and repeat in 7 days.

When using a topical cream, lotion, or ointment, be sure to follow these steps (unless your physician gives other instructions):

    For adults, apply to the entire body except for the face and scalp.
    For patientren, apply to the entire body, including the face and scalp, as these areas are commonly infested.
    Smear the product beneath the fingernails and toenails.
    Apply to body folds, including inside the navel, in the buttocks crease, and between the fingers and toes.

In more severe cases of scabies, your doctor may prescribe oral medications:

    Ivermectin (Stromectol®) pills – Take once and then repeat 1–2 weeks later. Do not give to patientren aged younger than 5 years or who weigh less than 15 kg (about 35 lb), or pregnant or lactating women.
    Antibiotic, if any scratched areas appear to be infected with bacteria. 

After treatment, the rash and itching may take up to 4 weeks to go away, as your immune system continues to react to the dead mites. However, new burrows and rashes should stop appearing 48 hours after effective treatment. If you see new burrows or bumps, or if the itch continues for more than 4 weeks, you may need to be treated again. 

Your doctor may also recommend steroid creams or antihistamine pills to relieve the itching. In severe cases, oral steroids may be required to decrease symptoms.

Because it may take up to 6 weeks after exposure to develop symptoms, people may be unaware that they are infested. Therefore, household members, sexual partners, and anyone else with prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person should also be treated. Ideally, everyone should be treated at the same time in order to prevent reinfestation."
nail_melanoma,"Subungual melanoma is treated surgically. Your doctor will first remove your entire nail and then remove the growth. To date, surgery is the only viable treatment method for this type of melanoma. Today, many subungual melanomas are treated more conservatively with only the local removal of the tumor.1 When amputation is indicated, it often involves only the first joint nearest the fingernail. For toenails, amputation to the second joint is more common. For advance subungual melanoma, other types of therapy may be needed, including:

    Chemotherapy, given either systemically through a vein or directly into the tumor
    Radiation therapy, used primarily as a palliative treatment to decrease pain
    Immunotherapy, a newer form of cancer therapy that aims to stimulate the immune system to fight cancerous cells
    Targeted therapies, such as drugs able to target the BRAF mutations that occur in 50% of melanomas"
prorigo_nodularis,"Due to the intensity of the itch, people with PN may try several different treatments without receiving much relief.  Some people may try all current treatments available without receiving complete relief. For most people, a combination of several treatments may need to be tried to find out what will work best.

The most commonly used treatments for PN are: 
    Corticosteroid creams that are applied to the nodules (topical) and covered with special bandages that are air- and water-tight
    Corticosteroid injections into the nodules
    Ointments with menthol or phenol to cool and soothe itchy skin
    Capsaicin cream
    Oral corticosteroids
    Oral antihistamines
    Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

If these treatments are not effective, other procedures may be used. These include cryotherapy, which uses very cold temperatures to try to reduce the size of the nodules, or laser therapy. Some people have used photochemotherapy, which combines the use of a medication that increases the skin’s sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays with special light therapy. In some cases, immunosuppressants have been used to treat PN. If the lesions become infected, antibiotics or antibiotic ointment may be prescribed.[3] 

All treatments are typically used in combination with habit reversal therapy, which aims to reduce the frequency of scratching the skin. This can be helpful in slowing down or stopping the cycle of itching and scratching that is associated with PN. Some people wear gloves while they sleep to reduce scratching"
acne vulgaris,"Treatment options for acne vulgaris include:   
Resist picking at lesions.
Avoid irritants (rubbing and other alcohols, abrasive scrubs) and oily creams, cosmetics, hair products, and sunscreens.
Use products labeled ""water-based"" or ""noncomedogenic.""
Keep hair, hands, and devices such as cell phones off the face.
Avoid greasy products on the skin and scalp. Gently cleanse with mild soap or cleansers. (But don't scrub!)      "
alopecia,"alopecia  can be a serious disease, particularly when widespread or resistant to treatment. Therefore it is essential that the patient is  examined by a specially trained physician."
actinic cheilitis,"Treatment options for acne vulgaris include:  Wearing barrier clothing (eg, wide-brimmed hats) and sunscreen-containing lip balms can aid in preventing actinic cheilitis."
Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Treatment of a biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma depends upon many factors, including the subtype of basal cell carcinoma, its size, its location on the face or body, and the general health of the patient.
Therefore it is essential that the patient is  examined by a specially trained physician."
bullous pemphigoid,"Bullous pemphigoid can be a serious disease, particularly when widespread or resistant to treatment. Therefore it is essential that the patient is  examined by a specially trained physician."
Lyme Disease,"Ticks begin transmitting Lyme disease about 24–48 hours after attaching to the host. You can reduce your child's chances of getting Lyme disease by removing the tick within 48 hours.

To remove the tick, you will need tweezers and isopropyl alcohol. Your child may be scared, but you should explain that this will not hurt them.

Sterilize the tweezers with alcohol and make sure to wash your hands. You should not clean or disturb the skin with the tick.
Grasp the part of the tick that is embedded in the skin with the tweezers, not the body where you may see tiny legs. If necessary, have someone else hold the area with the tick so that the child doesn't jerk away.
The tick will likely be firmly embedded. Pull it outward in one motion. Do not twist or jerk the tweezers. Do not apply anything to the tick that you think may help it come out smoothly as this may result in a part of the tick being left in the skin.
Clean the bite wound with alcohol. Children have very sensitive skin, so you may notice an immediate swelling where the once was. If you are not sure that the entire tick has been removed, see your child's doctor.
Observe the bitten area for the appearance of a rash for up to a month after the bite. It is probably best to call your child's doctor for further guidance if you think he or she has been bitten by a tick. If a rash or other early symptoms of Lyme disease develop, see a physician immediately."
Psoriasis,"Because psoriasis is a lifelong condition for which there is currently no cure, the goal of therapy is to decrease the number of lesions and improve symptoms, such as itching and irritation.

Bathe daily to help remove scale and moisten the skin. Avoid harsh soaps; soap substitutes are milder for your skin.
Apply moisturizers to all scaly psoriasis patches after any water exposure or bathing. Heavier oil-based moisturizers help to retain water in the skin better than water-based moisturizers.
Apply hydrocortisone cream (0.5 or 1%), available over the counter, to help reduce itch and redness.
Use products with salicylic acid (shampoos, cleansers, and ointments) to help soften and remove heavy scale.
Small doses of natural sunlight may be helpful, such as 10–15 minutes 2 or 3 times a week. Avoid too much sun, however, and protect your healthy skin from sun exposure.
There is also an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer and lymphoma in people with psoriasis. For this reason, monthly skin self-exams and regular visits to your doctor are important."
vitiligo,"vitiligo  can be a serious disease, particularly when widespread or resistant to treatment. Therefore it is essential that the patient is  examined by a specially trained physician."
